It closed its doors in January 2014.Mission and Purpose  AmericaSpeaks is a non-profit and non-partisan organization that focuses on organizing regional and national citizen meetings. The mission of AmericaSpeaks is to “reinvigorate American democracy by engaging citizens in the public decision-making that most impacts their lives.”  [1]  The primary focus of the meetings is issues that revolve around issues with a significant budget impact. Another focus of AmericaSpeaks is to integrate solid democratic deliberation with  technology  and new media. Their aim for national citizen meetings goes beyond the small groups within a given community. AmericaSpeaks wants to connect citizens not only from different cultural backgrounds, but also geographic backgrounds. This is achieved with the utilization of satellites, keypad  polling , and web conferences in order to connect citizens across the nation.  In addition to civic and technological engagement, AmericaSpeaks seeks to expand academia’s knowledge on the deliberative process. A subgroup of AmericaSpeaks known as the Democracy Lab for Research and Innovation has three goals in this field. They aim to “expand our knowledge about the practice of public deliberation, develop new and better ways to engage citizens to improve democratic processes and institutions, and foster and increase collaboration within the field of deliberative democracy.”  [2]  AmericaSpeaks envisions that their citizen forums will inspire the ""public's business [to] be conducted differently - that by developing a rich national infrastructure for democratic deliberation through our projects, innovation and collaboration, [government] can access the collective wisdom of the American people.”  [3]   Origins and Development  AmericaSpeaks was founded in 1995. Since then, it has engaged over 145,000 people in over 50 large-scale forums in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. AmericaSpeaks aims to bring citizens together to deliberate about critical policy issues. The conclusions from these meetings are then brought to the attention of decision-makers in the hopes that citizen input will influence policy.  In 1994, after more than ten years of service in the public sector, AmericaSpeaks president Carolyn Lukensmeyer had grown concerned that citizens were increasingly being shut out of public decision-making processes. Carolyn traveled the United States and held vision meetings to conceptualize a model for large-scale citizen engagement forums, and a vision for how these forums could be used in national dialogues on key public policy issues. AmericaSpeaks’ mission is to create innovative mechanisms through which citizens can enhance their voice in local, regional, and national governance, and to renew democracy through the development of a national infrastructure for democratic deliberation and citizen engagement.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  AmericaSpeaks is non-partisan and non-profit organization that receives its funding from over 90 current and recent contributors. Some major contributors include the National 4-H Council, the Pew Charitable Trust Fund, United Nations Environment Programme, the World Economic Fourm, in addition to many cities being direct contributors.  [5]   Some events, such as the Our Budget, Our Economy National Town Meeting, have recieved special or one-time grants from philanthropic organizations like the the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, E.K. Kellogg Foundation, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.  [6]   Specializations, Methods and Tools  AmericaSpeaks has developed and facilitated deliberative methods such as the  21st Century Town Meeting , which enables facilitated discussion for 500 to 5,000 participants.  AmericaSpeaks’  21st Century Town Meeting  is intended to create engaging, meaningful opportunities for citizens to participate in public decision making. This process attempts to update the traditional  New Englandtown meeting  to address the needs of today’s citizens, decision makers and democracy. Unlike most of New England's town meetings, however, it is not a formal legislative body, and therefore none of the decisions are binding.  The 21st Century Town Meeting marks a departure from traditional public participation methods, such as public hearings. The 21st Century Town Meeting focuses on discussion and deliberation among citizens rather than speeches, question-and-answer sessions or panel presentations. The purpose of the Town Hall Meeting is to gather diverse groups of citizens who will participate in round-table discussions (10-12 people per table) and deliberate in depth about key policy issues. Each table discussion is supported by a trained facilitator to keep participants on task. Participants receive discussion guides that present further information about the issues under consideration.  Technology collects the individual table discussions and the results are compiled into a set of collective recommendations. Each table submits ideas using wireless groupware computers and each participant can vote on specific proposals with keypad polling. These two pieces of technology allow for real-time reporting and voting. Results from discussions are presented to participants within minutes and polling results within seconds. The entire group votes on the final recommendations to submit to decision makers. Before the meeting ends, results from the meeting are put into a report, which is distributed to participants, decision makers and the news media as they leave.  Major Projects and Events  21st Century Summit  The 21st Century Summit was created to help organization leaders tap into the collective wisdom of their constituents and stakeholders through large-scale meetings. During discussions, participants identify shared priorities and develop recommendations on essential policies and plans. At the meeting, AmericaSpeaks attempts to help attendees explore key issues, weigh critical trade offs, and deepen their connection and commitment to next steps. AmericaSpeaks has more than a decade of experience with engaging large numbers of members, employees or stakeholders – 50 to 5,000 at a single meeting – in a strategic, outcomes-oriented discussion. The method integrates recent technology with facilitated dialogue, and provides the tools to enable groups to examine important options and identify mutual priorities.Americans Discuss Social Security""Americans Discuss Social Security"" was a 1998 non-partisan effort funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, that directly engaged a diverse sample of Americans in a dialogue about Social Security (United States)|Social Security reform and recommended that the United States Congress support legislation that reflected citizen preferences. Over fifteen months, the project engaged nearly 45,000 Americans in every state in direct discussions on Social Security reform and reached more than twelve million through the project’s media and public education efforts.  Citizen Summits in Washington, DC  Beginning in 1999 and lasting until 2005, Mayor Anthony Williams partnered with AmericaSpeaks in an attempt to restore Washingtonians' faith in the government and gather recommendations for budgeting allocation. Over 13,500 citizens participated in seven 21st Century Town Meetings.  Because of the Citizen Summits, millions of dollars were budgeted to areas over which citizens voiced concern, including: an additional $270 million for education; $10 million for senior services; 1,000 new drug treatment slots; an additional $25 million for a housing trust fund; $2 million for citizen involvement; and nearly $20 million for more police and juvenile-related initiatives. Also, the mayor's office created and implemented the Office of Neighborhood Action, which is responsible for ensuring that citizens have a voice in shaping the city’s priorities.  Redeveloping Ground Zero  Listening to the City was held at the Javits Center in New York City in July 2002 to involve 4300 local citizens, who closely reflected the demographic diversity of the region, in the planning process for Ground Zero's future. Decision-makers from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority co-sponsored the meeting and incorporated it into their official public engagement process. After a day of intense deliberation, participants determined that the original plans for the redevelopment of the World Trade Center failed to meet the needs of the city. Within a week of Listening to the City, decision-makers announced that the plans would be redrawn in accordance with public priorities. A two-week online deliberation and dialogue reached another 800 New York City residents who reviewed the site options in small cyber groups.  2005 World Economic Forum  The 2005 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland featured a Global  Town Hall  Meeting by AmericaSpeaks’ international arm, Global Voices, where 700 world leaders prioritized and addressed some of the toughest issues facing the global community. Poverty and Equitable Globalization were voted the two top priorities.  Meeting of the Minds: European Citizens' Deliberate on Brain Science  Over the course 2005, 126 citizens met up a handful of times within their own country and twice with citizens from other countries in order to discuss “the ethical, social, and legal implications of brain science policy and technology.” Participating nations included Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungry, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.  [4]  The focus of the discussion was broken up into 6 themes: regulation and control, normalcy vs. diversity, information and communication, equal access to treatment, pressure from economic interests, and freedom of choice.  After these meetings, the citizens turned in a summary of their findings in January of 2006 to the European Parliament. These recommendations and insights were later used by other organizations such as the European Group on Ethics in Science, the European Union, and New Technologies. This project was run by the pan-national department of AmericaSpeaks, known as  Global Voices.Our Budget, Our EconomyThousands of citizens from 20 major cities are expected to participate in a national discussion set to take place on June 26, 2010. Unlike previous AmericaSpeak forums, this will be the first of their forums that will have different cities simultaneously and collectively participate with others. 32 individuals from Institutions such as the Heritage Foundation plus local outreach partners will comprise AmericaSpeak’s Nation Advisory Committee that will oversee the proceedings. These people will act as moderators and advisors for the meetings.  The main issue of the forum is the recent budget crisis and discussing solutions to the nation’s recession. After the meeting has taken place, the opinions and recommendations of the participants will be condensed into a report that will be presented to the National Commission on Responsibility and Reform and the Bi-Partisan Policy Center’s Debt Reduction Task Force.PartnershipsVoices &amp; Choices  AmericaSpeaks partnered with the Fund for Our Economic Future to organize a series of town meetings and public forums across northeast Ohio to enable thousands of people to come together to create a strategic plan for revitalizing the region's economy. One of the largest public deliberations convened, Voices &amp; Choices combined a variety of approaches for mobilizing the region’s citizenry, including one-on-one interviews, online forums and two large-scale 21st Century Town Meetings. Over 20,000 participants identified the region’s strengths, identified and prioritized its most important challenges and brainstormed solutions.  Citizens' Health Care Working Group  AmericaSpeaks worked with the Citizens' Health Care Working Group to engage thousands of Americans in a national discussion on health care reform. 21st Century Town Meetings were held in Los Angeles and Cincinnati. Smaller forums were held in other cities throughout the nation.  Unified New Orleans Plan  AmericaSpeaks partnered with the Unified New Orleans Plan to bring together nearly 4000 New Orleanians in two large-scale public meetings to develop and review elements of a city wide-plan for recovery. The December 2006 and January 2007 Community Congresses were multi-site meetings that connected participants over geographical distances using satellite video and webcast.  Community Congress II (December 2 2006) and Community Congress III (January 20, 2007) were both held simultaneously in New Orleans and other American cities with the large numbers of Katrina evacuees (New Orleans diaspora). AmericaSpeaks partnered with the Unified New Orleans Plan to design, recruit participants and implement these meetings. When polled at the meetings, the participant groups closely approximated the pre-Katrina demographics of New Orleans: In pre-Katrina New Orleans, 67% were African-American and 37% had household income under $20,000; at Community Congress II, 64% were African-American and 25% had household income under $20,000; at Community Congress III, 55% were African-American and 24% had household income under $20,000. Renters, however, were significantly underrepresented - prior to Hurricane Katrina, 54% of the population were renters, while they made up only 29% of the participants.  The meetings connected New Orleanians at home with friends and neighbors who have not yet made it home through the use of Internet webcast technology or closed circuit television. Community Congress III presented the draft plan to citizens, incorporating many of the recommendations from Community Congress II, and 92% of participants expressed support for the Plan to go forward.  In late May 2007, $117 million in federal block grants was released for infrastructure repairs when the Louisiana Recovery Authority board accepted New Orleans' citywide recovery plan. The money is the first step toward financing a city recovery plan officials say will cost $1.1 billion. When releasing the money, The Louisiana Recovery Authority board recognized that the Unified New Orleans Plan was a citizen- driven recovery vision developed with ""unprecedented participation and representation from every part of the city.""  CaliforniaSpeaks  Nearly 3,500 Californians gathered in eight cities on August 11, 2007 in an interactive forum on health care priorities called  CaliforniaSpeaks , and 82 percent advocated major changes. The project was created and led by AmericaSpeaks.  The most popular suggestions called for putting people before profit, prioritizing wellness and prevention, and making health care affordable and accessible to everyone. The statewide conversation was created to enable ordinary Californians to tell state lawmakers what they think about the current health care reform proposals. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, Senate President pro Tem Don Perata, Assembly Republican Leader Mike Villines and other Republican and Democratic legislators attended the event. Each of the lawmakers emphasized his commitment to passing health care reform in 2007.  The real-time, nonpartisan health care discussion blended small-group dialogue with cutting-edge technology. Satellite television, webcast, simultaneous television broadcast, groupware and individual voting keypads were used. Forums were held in Sacramento, San Diego, Eureka, Fresno, Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Oakland-San Francisco and Riverside-San Bernardino.  Democracy Lab for Innovative and Research  AmericaSpeaks is dedicated to advancing citizen deliberation and aims to one day create an infrastructure in the United States that deeply incorporates citizens into the decision-making process. The Democracy Lab for Innovation and Research is AmericaSpeaks’ think tank on deliberative democracy and citizen engagement. The  Democracy Lab  develops methods to advance and sustain citizen engagement in the public policy process. AmericaSpeaks formed the Democracy Lab in order to: Improve democratic processes and institutions by creating a new governance mechanism that will regularly convene diverse groups of Americans on key policy questions and incorporate citizen voices into policy making; Enhance and improve AmericaSpeaks’ approach to citizen engagement, such as developing new models for sustaining citizen participation and turning initial participation in deliberation into long-term citizen engagement and action; Evaluate the impact of AmericaSpeaks’ citizen engagement initiatives; Strengthen the deliberative democracy field by disseminating knowledge gained by AmericaSpeaks through its projects and research. AmericaSpeaks routinely brings together leading scholars and practitioners from the field of deliberative democracy to develop insights into and solutions for key questions in the field of citizen engagement.

They wondered whether greater participation of the public in political processes could lead to better, fairer, more sustainable decisions, and, if so, how this could best be achieved.  During 2008, the Partnership for Public Participation was formed to research experiences and results of public participation throughout the world, but particularly in three European countries of interest to the partners: Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. This led directly to the report, Public Participation in Europe,[1] which highlighted three key factors that need to be addressed for public participation to be effective:A clearly defined constitutional framework for public participation. Only through an explicit, shared understanding between politicians and citizens can confidence be developed and public participation realize its democratizing potential.  A systematic approach to public participation methods to help organizers of public participation processes choose the most suitable and effective methods.  Rigorous and challenging evaluation of public participation in practice to develop a culture of learning about participation and advance the systematization of participation methods.EIPP was launched on 1 January 2009 specifically to address these issues.Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  EIPP is a not-for-profit organisation which receives core funding from its founder members and project funding from clients to undertake research, evaluation and dissemination activities.Specializations, Methods and Tools  EIPP is involved in three main activities.Research  Undertaking research into public participation activities, mainly, but not exclusively, in Europe. Examples of this include the research undertaken across Europe in 2008 as the basis for the Public Participation in Europe report, and a current project for the  Bertelsmann Foundation  carrying out a detailed analysis of participatory methods in Germany.Evaluation  The key to understanding what works, when in public participation is rigorous evaluation, based not simply on feedback from the participants, but on a set of predefined extrinsic criteria such as: did it result in fairer, more sustainable, more legitimate decisions? EIPP has recently completed a major evaluation of  BürgerForum Europa , a large-scale participatory process over eight months, which developed understanding of how German citizens view the future of Europe and involved politicians at the highest level (including German Chancellor, Angela Merkel).  EIPP is currently developing the European Evaluation Framework for Public Participation with partners across Europe and looking to test this with a range of live participation activities, including  Participatory Budgeting  in the UK.Dissemination of What Works, When  EIPP seeks to disseminate the findings of its research and evidence-based evaluation through any appropriate channels such asreports, e.g. Public Participation in Europe  newspaper articles, e.g.  Rezepte gegen die Europamüdigkeitbroadcast interviews, e.g.  Quest'Europa s'ha da fareconferences and seminarsMajor Projects and EventsCitizens' Forum EuropeAnalysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Steinberg relied on the ideas of the article by setting up mySociety outside of government and attempting to directly empower the civil society. mySociety has two pronounced missions:  “The first is to be a charitable project which builds websites that give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives. The second is to teach the public and voluntary sectors, through demonstration, how to use the internet most efficiently to improve lives.”[1]  The organization attempts to build minimalistic  websites  which embody cheap scalability and tangible outputs. It is politically neutral and non-partisan.[1] Nearly all its code is open source.[3]Origins and DevelopmentmySociety was founded in September 2003 by Tom Steinberg,[1] and spent the first year raising money and looking for ideas.

A registered charity, the organization substantially relies on volunteer help and encourages all kinds of contributions, including the possibility to run entire sites as part of mySociety (e.g., the PlanningAlerts website designed by Richard Pope). [1]  mySociety's staff works on both charitable and commercial projects; the organization ""charges SocietyWorks Ltd for the staff time used for commercial work.""[5] Many charitable initiatives begin as volunteers' private projects.[5] This work is funded by a multiple means: ""grants from charitable foundations, donations from private individuals, and commercial income from its trading subsidiary.""[6]  mySociety is governed by a volunteer Board of Trustees who oversee the group's activities and ensure compliance with legal requirements.[5]Specializations, Methods and ToolsIn its aims to encourage and facilitate active citizenship, mySociety builds and shares  online technologies . Their research involves ""analysing data, conducting fieldwork, looking at outcomes, assessing reach, and... user interventions,"" all with the hopes of understanding ""the true impact of digital tools on government and civic engagement.""[7]Major Projects and EventsTheyWorkForYou  Originally built almost entirely by a dozen volunteers,  TheyWorkForYou  [8] is mySociety’s most visited site (attracting more than two million users in 2007 alone). TheyWorkForYou provides citizens with a range of information on their politicians, such as: who their local MP is; what MPs said in Parliament; summaries of how MPs have voted; text of debates in Parliament; videos of MPs talking in debates; written questions MPs have submitted to government departments, and the answers they have got back; email alerts whenever an MP speaks, or a topic is mentioned in Parliament; comments and annotations from users on what has been said, and more.  In July 2009, mySociety reported that the coverages of TheyWorkForYou has been extended to include the House of Commons debates starting from the 1935 general election and general information on MPs is available from the beginning of the 19th century.[9]  Along with the UK Parliament, the TheyWorkForYou project also covers the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Welsh Assembly. Similar projects at various times operated in:New Zealand:  www.theyworkforyou.co.nzUnited States: www.opencongress.org  Australia: www.openaustralia.com  Ireland: www.kidarestreet.com.In advance of the 2005 general election, the British Channel 4 used a branded version of TheyWorkForYou to supply their MP data.[10] The site won the Community and Innovation award in the 2005 New Statesman New Media Awards, with the judges saying that they ""were unanimous in feeling that TheyWorkForYou was the nomination that has done most to contribute to civic society in the UK.""[11] In the House of Lords, in a debate on the Power Inquiry, Lord Gould of Brookwood referred to TheyWorkForYou and the other mySociety sites as ""probably the biggest single catalyst for political change in this country"".[12] In 2008, The Daily Telegraph rated it 41st in a list of the 101 most useful websites.[13]  FixMyStreet  As an online service, FixMyStreet [14] allows users to easily report broken infrastructure in their area to the local authority; and to start, or take part in public discussions about maintaining and improving the infrastructure and environment in their neighbourhoods. The reports are posted on the website using a web-based  mapping  tool and then transferred by mySociety to the appropriate local councils, who are supposed to take care of the repairs.  According to mySociety, the aim of FixMyStreet is “to transform the act of reporting faults – turning it from a private one-to-one process into a public experience where anyone can see what has been reported. [They] also aim to lower barriers to communication between local government and communities and to build a sense of engagement and inclusion in the process of maintaining and improving the public infrastructure and environment in neighbourhoods.” [15]  Aside from posting new reports, the website allows users to view old reports and local alerts for each geographic area, follow the state of reports, and monitor the work of local representatives. The website also allows officials to leave comments and updates with regards to the reported problem and encourages local residents to discuss the problem and update others.  FixMyStreet can also be a tool for a better community organization. For instance, a community in Great Yarmouth joined forces through FixMyStreet to clear their local unused railway track.[16] The website made possible a dialogue between community members and the council’s community development worker.  As of October 4, 2009, the FixMyStreet declared that it received 730 new reports in the past week, 1,044 reports were fixed in the last month, and 55,171 updates were posted on reports. The state of all reports can be viewed on the website.[17]  The website has been developed by mySociety and the Young Foundation, with funding from the Department of Constitutional Affairs Innovations Fund. In December 2008, mySociety introduced an iPhone app for FixMyStreet, available to download from the App Store.[18]  Projects based on the model of FixMyStreet currently operate in the Netherlands ( http://www.verbeterdebuurt.nl ), New Zealand (http://www.fixmystreet.org.nz) and Canada ( http://www.fixmystreet.ca/ ).  No. 10 Petitions Website  Launched following a request by the Prime Minister's office in 2006, the No 10 Petitions website [19] was the largest British non-partisan democracy site by volume of users as of 2011, with over 8 million signatures from over 5 million unique email addresses, representing around 10% of the UK population. At its peak, nearly 200,000 people signed up to the service in a single day, and 20,000 within a single hour.[20]  To sign a  petition , a user had to provide their name, address, and a verifiable email. The creator of a petition could decide for how long they wanted to keep it open (the longest period being 12 months). One could add their signature to an existing petition by providing the same details (name, address, and email). Once a petition was closed, usually provided there were 500 signatures or more, it was passed to officials who work for the Prime Minister in Downing Street, or sent to the relevant Government department for a response. Every person who signed one received an email detailing the Government's response to the issues raised.[21] Government responses to popular petitions are the rule rather than the exception to it, and petitions with as few as 101 signatures have received official responses.  As of October 2009, there were over 4,600 open  petitions , and almost 35,000 petitions created since the creation of the website. According to mySociety,  “for legal and anti-spam reasons this site cannot host every petition submitted, but the rule is to accept everything that meets the terms and conditions of use. No petition will be rejected unless it violates these terms. And even when petitions cannot be hosted No.10 will still publish as much of rejected petitions as is consistent with legal and anti-spam requirements, including the reason why it could not be hosted.”[22]  The largest petition to date garnered over 1.8 million signatures and asked for the intervention of a planned vehicle tracking and road pricing scheme. It met a 1200 word response from Prime Minister Tony Blair which both acknowledged the petition's argument and defended the government's position.[23]  WhatDoTheyKnow  Launched in 2008, WhatDoTheyKnow[24] allows users to send out requests for information to different government departments and agencies. A user may pick a department, type a request, and mySociety forwards it to the appropriate governmental officials. All the requests are proceeded according to the British Freedom of Information Act, 2000 (FOI). The website also contains an archive of requests and responses made by other people, and it is possible to set up email or RSS alerts to get notified about interesting developments.  According to governmental statistics released in October 2009,  ""13.1% of all FOI requests to “Departments of State” in the second quarter of 2009 were made via WhatDoTheyKnow.com (up from 8.5% in the first quarter of 2009). In absolute terms, this was 753 out of 5769 requests.  32.3% of FOI requests to the Home Office (which includes the UKBA and the IPS) were made via WhatDoTheyKnow in the second quarter of 2009. In absolute terms, this was 206 out of 638 requests.  The [2011] figures also show that in twelve of the UK’s twenty-one Departments of State more than 10% of FOI requests were made via WhatDoTheyKnow.""[25]  WriteToThem  Launched in 2005, WriteToThem[26] allows users to send messages to any politician in the UK and publishes league tables of MP responsiveness every year.  In 2008, WriteToThem sent a total of 183,493 messages to elected representatives. The average response rate (within 2 or 3 weeks) was 59%, with 52% of the users writing for the first time to a politician of any kind.[27] Since its creation, the website helped users send more than 450,000 messages.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

The 50 organizations that had formed the Coalition for a National Conference on Dialogue &amp; Deliberation decided to continue working together, becoming the founding members of the National Coalition for Dialogue &amp; Deliberation (NCDD).[4]  Between the 2002 and 2004 conferences, a recognizable “dialogue and deliberation community” began to develop. Sharing resources, news, and opportunities became a hallmark of the Coalition’s work and NCDD continues to address disconnects in between practitioners, scholars, and participants in dialogue &amp; deliberation by providing a variety of activities, collaborative projects, and resources to its members and others the field.[5]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  NCDD’s Founding Director is Sandy Heierbacher, Courtney Breese is Managing Director, Joy Garman is Office Manager, and Keiva Hummel is the Communications Coordinator.  NCDD is made up of over 700 members encompassing a broad range of practitioners, organizations, researchers, public administrators, activists and students involved in the field of dialogue, deliberation, and collaborative action.[6]  Funding for NCDD is provided through membership dues and by sponsoring organizations. Organizational memberships are $200-$350/year and individuals can become Members for $75/year or $7.50/month. Student Memberships are also available for $30/year. Sponsorship starts at $1,000 and helps support NCDD’s network and operations.[7]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The National Coalition for Dialogue &amp; Deliberation supports the work of D&amp;D practitioners: those who “bring people together across divides to discuss, decide, and take action together effectively on today’s toughest issues.”[8] The Coalition providing its members with opportunities to gather and exchange knowledge, resources and teaching guides, news about new developments in the field, and a variety of recurring events.  Its National Conferences are highly participatory, involving plenary sessions as a way to showcase innovative large-group dialogue and deliberation techniques – often blending methods to better meet the group’s needs - and to utilize the wisdom in the room to tackle challenges facing this emerging field. Concurrent  workshops , led by key leaders and innovators in the field, allow participants to build skills, increase knowledge, broaden awareness, and build relationships. Arts and culture also play a prominent role in each conference.[9]  NCDD’s resource section of its website is publicly-accessible, offering information on everything from teaching manuals to case studies and program evaluations.[10] Its popular Engagement Streams framework helps community leaders, public officials, and others decide when best to use different engagement processes, based on their goals and means.[11]  Major Projects and Events  Confab Calls  NCDD’s “Confab calls” give members the opportunity to connect with each other, hear about exciting projects in dialogue &amp; deliberation, and explore the field’s most pressing challenges. Audio recordings, video recordings, and archives of the collaborative documents created by participants are all made available to members. Examples of past Confab Calls include:A discussion between engagement practitioners &amp; journalists on partnering to help bring people together across differences  Michelle Vilchez and Malissa Netane-Jones shared their experience working with communities and law enforcement at the Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center  Linda Ellinor and Paul Cienfuegos of Community Rights US talked about the community rights movement and its impact on dialogue and deliberation efforts at a local level  Senator John Unger discussed how community engagement during his campaign lead to his re-election[12]Tech Tuesday Learning Events  NCDD’s semi-monthly Tech Tuesday series invites leaders in the field of online technology to share their innovations and ways to use online tools to support engagement work. Past speakers have included Ethelo, Konveio, Citizens Foundation, and the Urban Interactive Studio.[13]  National Conferences  NCDD has held National Conferences on Dialogue &amp; Deliberation every two years since 2002. NCDD's national conferences place special emphasis on the goal of strengthening and uniting the rapidly-growing dialogue and deliberation community.[14] The Conferences have been held in different cities in the United States and have attracted over 3000 participants from over 20 countries.[15]  Other Projects and Engagements  NCDD has also come to play a strong facilitative leadership role in the emerging field of dialogue and deliberation by collaborating with its members on a variety of projects and programs. Examples include:Public Engagement Principles (PEP) Project: beginning in February 2009, NCDD initiated and co-led (with the International Association for Public Participation and the Co-Intelligence Institute) a collaborative project to create a set mutually-agreed upon Core Principles for Public Engagement[16]  Upgrading the Way We Do Politics: developed in the fall of 2009 in response to the controversial health care town halls held during the August congressional resource, NCDD members worked together to quickly create a series of articles and a one-page flyer to help public officials hold more productive public meetings[17]  Regional Conferences: in fall 2010, NCDD held 5 regional conferences instead of one national event. Over 700 people attended the events in Austin, Boston, Denver, Cupertino (Bay Area), and Portland[18]  Presentation on Audience Polling Systems 2015: co-hosted with the IAP2 Northern California Chapter in San Francisco the two-hour event included networking and a presentation from NCDD Supporting member David Campt titled “Paradigm Shift: How Facilitators Are Accelerating Their Practice Through Recent Developments on Audience Polling Systems.”[19]  Innovations in Participatory Democracy Conference 2018: hosted by NCDD member organizations the Participatory Budgeting Project and the Jefferson Center, as well as, the Center for the Future of Arizona, the Katal Center, the Participatory Governance Initiative at Arizona State University, Phoenix Union High School District, and the Policy Jury Group, the three-day conference hosted a wide range of innovators in community engagement and participatory democracy.[20]Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Reinventing Public ConsultationMASS is best known for its innovative approach to public engagement and consultation. First, they believe that public consultation is a form of cultural production. As such, success depends on the design choices their clients make when they create opportunities for members of the public to interact with and advise government. Since 2007, they have conducted twenty-five major reference panels, citizens’ assemblies and commissions for government, tackling some of the toughest and most divisive issues in public policy today. They also routinely host national, provincial and regional conversations, inviting Canadians to think about their country's future and their priorities for investment and reform.Creating Publics : Introducing the  Civic LotteryWorking with Canada Post, MASS mails tens of thousands of Canadian households each year inviting residents to volunteer to serve on one of several reference panels or commissions. Civic Lotteries produce random-representative cohorts that contain a wide range of perspectives and can speak for their communities. MASS is a global leader in the use of  sortition  to engage citizens in democratic processes.Convening Publics : Introducing the Reference Panel  Reference Panels are typically comprised of thirty-six randomly-selected residents who meet over several days to advise government on a specific policy issue. With an explicit mandate, these panels provide a deliberative forum in each to learn about a complex issue from leading experts and with the assistance of trained facilitators, find common ground. MASS has pioneered the design and use of Reference Panels to inform public policy choices in Canada.2. Developing Ambitious Strategies That Enjoy Public SupportStrategy isn't only about getting from A to B. When it comes to aligning divergent priorities, or getting clear about an organization's core values, there are no straight lines. This is especially true for public sector organizations which work to juggle changing political contexts, fiscal constraints, and the competing interests of stakeholders and communities. MASS LBP works with clients to develop strategies for organizations that they perceive to be serious about change. They approach strategy as a collaborative process that helps to establish priorities and new goals, with the aim of helping clients to raise their sights, strengthen their relationships, and reach agreement from first principles. Currently, their Strategy Practice works in two fields: first, to develop multi-year strategic plans and secondly, to develop engagement strategies that assist organizations to better integrate effective engagement techniques within existing governance and communications frameworks.3. Delivering Solid Research That Shapes Good ChoicesMASS provides policy-related research services to clients across many sectors. They routinely conduct wide-ranging environmental scans, prepare case studies and provocation papers, interview experts and stakeholders, commission essays from thought-leaders and host workshops to review findings or carry a discussion forward. MASS claims to provide insight, creativity and breadth, and to provide clear evidence and strong examples they can use to make their case. Using their knowledge of different policy areas and the state-of-play in different jurisdictions, they help clients to map out what's possible.Origins and DevelopmentInspired by Canada's first  Citizens' Assemblies , MASS LBP was founded in 2007 by Peter MacLeod and George Gosbee to extend this model and reinvent public consultation.  To date, MASS has conducted twenty-five major  reference panels , citizens assemblies and commissions for government involving more than 1000 Canadians, and reaching 250,000 households. Cumulatively, this represents some 30,000 hours of  deliberation  on significant public issues, making MASS an internationally-recognized leader in the design and delivery of deliberative processes for government. In addition, they provide a range of services to public sector organizations including strategic planning and communications, custom research, facilitation and hosting, as well as event coordination and logistics.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingMASS LBP is a highly collaborative organization that they believe works better and smarter when they are transparent and honest about funding; they value the conducting of business in full public view. There are only two salary levels at MASS. They often work on projects often funded with public monies and so, they believe clients and citizen-participants deserve to know what they earn.

This is underpinned by the conviction that a random selection of everyday citizens are more than capable of navigating and making decisions about complex political issues. As founder Luca Belgiorno-Nettis (2013) puts it:  Our focus is on everyday people being randomly selected to deliberate and see if a consensus view can be reached. I am willing to trust these people because of the diversity of skills in the community, and the fact they are beyond the reach of so many impairments we place on the judgment of the representatives we elect today. They have no political donations, no factions, no pre-selections to worry about, no special interest groups to campaign against them, no lobbyists with connections to them, no faceless men looming in the background! [1]  nDF’s approach is firmly underpinned by deliberative democratic theory. In creating deliberative spaces – such as the  Australian Citizens’ Parliament  – the foundation aims to contribute to a future deliberative community as envisaged by prominent scholars.[2][3] Indeed, since newDemocracy’s inception in 2004, deliberative democracy scholars have begun to look to the idea of ‘deliberative systems’ as a way of conceptualising deliberative democracy writ large.[4] nDF's original objectives were, through the creation of deliberative spaces, to promote a broader shift towards a more participatory, consensus-based political system. This is in sharp contrast to the adversarial, polarising rhetoric of Australian party politics.  newDemocracy is now well established in Australia as one of the foremost practitioners of deliberative democracy. They are particularly well-known for expertise in the recruitment process and facilitation of  citizens’ juries , as their body of work attests. nDF also retains its original commitment to changing Australia’s political system for the better, through establishing effective mechanisms for everyday people to deliberate and make public decisions. This is reflected in their advocacy for a Citizens’ Senate – with a House of randomly selected citizens performing the review function of the Upper House. This is ‘the pragmatic option for a step toward a non-partisan and deliberative parliament.’[5]  The Citizens’ Senate is one of several structural alternatives advocated by nDF for improving how politics is done in Australia.[5] These include  Demarchy , and Electronic  Town hall  and a Citizens’ Legislature. The structural alternatives suggested are grounded in academic research and offer a vision for a different type of politics. Alongside this they also argue in favour of a raft of incremental alternatives – improvements that could be made to the current political system as it stands.  Origins and Development  nDF was founded in 2004 by Luca Belgiorno-Nettis, who ‘wanted to find out if innovation in democracy was possible. It is.’[1] newDemocracy’s inception was a considered response against the often toxic, tit-for-tat character of partisan politics in Australia. nDF advocated a real alternative to this in their support for deliberative democratic processes that gave ordinary people the time, space and relevant information to deliberate on the current political system and how it could be improved.  This alternative approach became tangible reality with the first Australian Citizens’ Parliament in 2009, funded by nDF and the Australian Research Council. The focus of the process – involving 150 randomly selected Australians – was to deliberate on how Australian’s political system could be strengthened to better serve its citizens.  Since the Citizens’ Parliament, nDF have become perhaps best known for their expertise in random selection and the organisation and facilitation of mini-publics. They have been commissioned by local councils and state governments across four states to run deliberative processes on diverse topics – from electoral reform to local infrastructure. In addition to running deliberative forums, nDF advocates deliberative democratic approaches – in particular the citizens’ jury model – directly to state and federal government through its submissions to various committees.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingnDF is a non-profit, non-partisan organisation and relies primarily on donors[6] for its income and has received major donations from the Anita and Luca Belgiorno-Nettis Foundation and Google Australia. In addition, the foundation is commissioned by government and others to run various projects, which are budgeted on a cost recovery basis and vary project to project.  nDF also funds research into deliberative democracy more broadly.Specializations, Methods, and ToolsA  random selection  of citizens in a jury format – a  citizens’ jury  – is central to newDemocracy’s approach to improving the democratic process. The following information is summarised from the nDF website and describes their overall approach:[7]Random Selection:Governments inevitably hear from the noisiest voices who insist on being heard. In contrast, society trusts 12 randomly-selected people on a criminal jury to assess evidence, discuss their views and reach a consensus recommendation because random selection generates “people like us”. Our process gets beyond the enraged and the articulate because the public would perceive them as having a bias.Time:Most policy problems which warrant the investment in a jury will be complex topics, so we need to allow people the time to educate and immerse themselves in the topic. Faced with a clear remit and a worthwhile level of authority citizens will invest the time.Information:Neutrality of information is a core principle, and we are careful to alert all juries that all writers have their own bias and perspective and they need to critically analyse this. To counter the view that “you can find an expert to say anything” we focus the start of a process on asking “what do you need to know... and who would you trust to inform you” – and use this as a way of selecting the speakers and input for subsequent jury meetings.Clear remit:A plain English question, phrased neutrally is essential.Upfront authority:To get everyday people in the room making a considerable time commitment, they need to know that the recommendations they reach mean something and won’t be consumed within the bureaucracy.Operation:For the purposes of shifting the mindset from adversarial, two-party, either/or contests, nDF recommends an 80% supermajority be required for a final decision from the jury. In practice, they rarely need to go to a vote and decisions are frequently unanimous, however minority views can be recorded and noted in reports as the objective is to most accurately reflect the view of the room.How do we randomly select participants?nDF directly undertakes the jury selection process to ensure there is the highest public confidence in the rigour and independence of the randomisation of invitations. Random selection is the key tool used to identify a range of participants who meet a descriptively representative sample of the community. We match participants to Census data by the key variables of age and gender, and others as each project requires. This is not claimed as a perfect method, but it delivers a more representative sample than any other process.  We post invitations to a random sample of physical addresses (not billing addresses) drawn from land titles information or Australia Post databases. This ensures that tenants and those not on electoral rolls are reached – in short, the widest possible catchment. Recipients of the invitation are asked to register online to indicate that they are available for the final selection. Based on those available, a second random draw is done which seeks to randomly match to the age and gender numbers required. This draw generates the final membership of the jury.  nDF does not provide any juror information to the governments or agencies with which we work.Stakeholder EngagementSince its inception in 2004, nDF has sought to improve and innovate with its work. nDF-commissioned research conducted by the Institute for Sustainable Futures in 2015[8] found that stakeholders did not always feel they understood the deliberative process and for some, this led to disengagement. In response to this, nDF now includes  stakeholder  engagement as a key component in all of its research designs. This includes stakeholder briefings prior to the process beginning, identifying key stakeholders to present to a jury or panel, as well as offering jurors the opportunity to select stakeholders of their own choosing to present information. This is alongside witnesses chosen by the commissioning body (e.g. council) and submissions from the wider community.Major projects and eventsnDF has been responsible for over 20 deliberative processes, consultations and policy submissions. Their first major project was the  Australian Citizens’ Parliament  in 2009 which brought together 150 citizens from around the country.  Other major projects include the  City of Melbourne People’s Panel  in 2014, which involved a broad community engagement process alongside a citizens’ jury to contribute to Melbourne’s 10-year financial plan. nDF also led on two juries in  Sydney  and  Adelaide  on creating a safe and vibrant nightlife.  nDF’s full body of work – along with reports, project designs and government responses can be found  here .

[2]  Their aim is to involve citizens in public decision making through participatory democracy in a variety of forms. In both the UK and internationally, Involve has worked with numerous governments, parliaments, civil society organisations, academics, and the public. Through these partnerships they make a practical difference by developing resources, offering support, and campaigning for public participation processes by undertaking ongoing rigorous research and policy analysis.  Origins and Development  Involve was founded in 2003 by Richard Wilson to determine how new forms of public participation in government could strengthen democracy in Britain. Involve has offices in Belfast, Edinburgh, and London.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingAs of 2021, Involve boasts 23 staff, 13 associates, and 9 Board members.  Everything we do is driven by our values:Collaboration – because change comes when broad coalitions of people worktowards a common vision;Equality – because everyone in society has an equal right to be listened to andparticipate in decisions that affect their lives. No one should be held back by societaldivisions or prejudice;Independence – because we are committed to the integrity and impartiality ofparticipatory and deliberative processes;Purpose – because participation must have an impact. We reject tokenistic orineffectual engagement; and,Quality – because effective participation requires time, attention and commitment. [3]Involve is classified as a charity and is funded through a variety of grants, awards, and donations; for a detailed list see  Who Funds Us .Specializations, Methods and ToolsInvolve has three focus areas:Making the case – demonstrating why participation and deliberation are essential features for a healthy modern democracy, and ensuring that those in positions of power and influence understand and support their use in addressing some of the UK’s most intractable issues.Embedding change – building the capacity of public servants and practitioners, and developing the body of evidence, principles and standards that support participatory and deliberative practice.Pioneering practice – encouraging widespread uptake of participatory and deliberative processes, and promoting continuous learning and innovation to improve democracy and deliver lasting solutions in key policy areas. [4] Through these specializations, Involve has transformed how leading public bodies and companies engage, including: Shell International, the OECD, Ministry of Justice, the  European Commission , the States of Jersey, the Sustainable Development Commission, the BBC and many local and regional governments.  Major Projects and Events  Involve's major projects can be sorted into five categories: (1) Unlocking citizen participation,(2) citizen participation in challenging issues, (3) embedding public engagement in government, (4) public engagement with fewer resources, and (5) promoting good practice.  1-Unlocking Citizen Participation  The goal of unlocking citizen participation is to explore what it is that citizens need in order to actively participate in their own communities. Past projects include Scouting Sunday, Involve and I&amp;DeA Informal Engagement in Health Guidance, and Say&amp;Play, a project meant to improve local government consultation by combining a community fun day with appropriate consultation methods. Currently they are working on Pathways through Participation, a lottery funded project exploring how and why people get involved and stay involved in different forms of participation throughout their lives.  2-Citizen Participation in Challenging Issues  To encourage citizen participation in challenging issues, Involve carries out research and develops new practices exploring how citizens can be engaged in complex technical or political debates to help decide a collaborative solution. Past projects include  The European Citizens' Consultation 2009 , a 3 stage  deliberation  event where citizens from all over Europe were assembled to deliberate on the continent's economic and social future. Currently they are working on putting together the Alberta Climate Dialogue, a similar event that will take place in Canada.  3-Embedding Public Engagement in Government  Involve projects with the goal of embedding public engagement in government focus on helping inwardly focused organizations to become more open to citizen involvement. A past success was Engaging With Impact, a joint project between Involve and  MASS LBP , a Canadian engagement innovator. The project examined the culture of engagement across Ontario's public health system, culminating in a report identifying indicators than can be used to improve public and patient engagement in the health area. Currently they are working on a project called Armchair Involvement where they conduct desk research, interviews, workshops and field research to identify the types of digital tools that are useful in encouraging patient and public involvement.  4-Public Engagement with Fewer Resources  Public engagement with fewer resources is aimed at discovering techniques to make getting citizens involved more efficient and effective. Involve conducts research to evaluate where public engagement can add value, and how to reduce government costs and make more effective decisions. An ongoing project is the Valuing Public Engagement project, a collaboration with Consumer Focus England to develop an equation for identifying costs and benefits associated with public engagement. They are also currently working on Efficiency Savings Through Engagement, where Involve provides a number of activities such as auditing current engagement activities, delivering a wide array of cost effective training, and building internal capacity through training and mentoring.  5-Promote Good Practice  Involve also promotes good practices for engagement activities in order to encourage others to participate. Their most notable project in this aspect was preparing a guide and providing mentorship for the staff from Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN) by outlining how to design and run effective dialogues with citizens. MOPAN a group of 14 donor nations surveying and assessing multilateral organizations in developing countries.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Involve is an organization that promotes deliberative and participatory forms of democracy and decision-making. They provide a solid and well-researched information base along with the resources and support needed further engagement and to discover the best techniques for more involved change.

Conflict Resolution TrainingThe CAEC uses participatory/ action research  and  community auditing  methods. In general, this means that members of the community are involved throughout the process, from planning and design to implementation and evaluation.  Participants usually receive training and accreditation (sometimes expenses, depending on budget) for their involvement. This process allows for the sharing and developing of skills in and through the community through audit teams.  Differing approaches are devised with the participants in order to be appropriate to them as well as to respect, recognise, and celebrate diversity and difference. The centre specialises in a variety of group work methods, such as  focus groups ,  workshops , and  forum theatre .EvaluationThe CAEC aims to support evidence-based practice by undertaking the evaluation of service provision and targeted initiatives, specialising in formative process and outcome evaluation projects, using inventive assessment tools e.g. parent identified 'protective factors' in the evaluation of young peoples drug intervention programmes.Major Projects and Events  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Publications  See AlsoCommunity AuditingReferencesThis entry is missing citations.

Their alliance works to share information, build knowledge and visibility, and effectively promote a citizen voice in government decision-making processes. Fundamental to the DDC’s work is the belief that the outcomes of  deliberation  result in qualitatively better and longer lasting decisions on policy matters, and that participation in deliberative opportunities is vital to reviving democracy. The DDC has set out on an impressive research agenda that aims to build knowledge around the actual impact of deliberation on civic attitudes and behavior. Their hypothesis is that: “with expanded application, increased frequency and greater visibility, deliberative democracy can invigorate and rekindle the civic virtues of trust, participation and responsibility.” The DDC believes that democratic deliberation is an influential, transformational experience for everyone involved, which can shift people’s attitudes toward the institutions and practice of democracy overall.  The Consortium has committed to the following goalsHelp public leaders find the examples and resources they need to engage citizens  Integrate research and practice in the field  Integrate online and face-to-face approaches  Articulate how democracy is changing  Help to build a permanent infrastructure for deliberative democracy  Encourage research and practice to support all aspects of deliberative democracy  Design of, and experimentation with, innovative deliberative practices  Develop evaluation models and tools  Relationship building, collaboration and convening within the field  Create connections between the field of deliberation and other related fields  Disseminate results to the public, decision-makers, academics, etc.  Promote the philosophy and methods of deliberative democracy to all levels of government  Increase the credibility and visibility of the deliberative democracy movement in the United States and around the world [1]Origins and Development  The DDC was founded in 2002 by leading organizations in the field of deliberative democracy. Tonya Gonzalez was the Consortium's first director; Matt Leighninger became the second in 2006 and the position is now held by Wendy Willis. [2]Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The activities of the Consortium are coordinated by an Executive Committee, chaired by Wendy Willis, Founder and Director of Oregon’s Kitchen Table Program, and co-chairs Kyle Bozentko or the  Jefferson Center  and Bruce L. Mallory, co-director of New Hampshire Listens. [3]   Organizational members of the Consortium include the  National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation  (NCDD), the  Jefferson Center , the  Kettering Foundation ,  Public Agenda , and  Everyday Democracy . [4]Specializations, Methods and ToolsOnline DeliberationWorkshopsMajor Projects and Events  The DDC used to comprise several Task Groups who organized activities associated with knowledge building, democratic governance, online deliberation and linking to government.  Knowledge Building  The Knowledge Building (KB) Task Group identified the necessary questions and collaborators that will advance knowledge and practice in the field of deliberative democracy. KB was led by Archon Fung (Harvard University) and Peter Levine (CIRCLE). The KB Task Group organized three Researcher and Practitioner Workshops in 2003, 2005, and 2007. The mission of the group was to “increase the quantity, quality and availability of knowledge about the theory and practice of deliberative democracy through: (1) setting the scholarly research agenda, (2) conducting high-quality research and experimentation on deliberative democratic practices, and (3) collecting and distributing knowledge about theory and practice to researchers and practitioners.”  Major goals the KB task group identified and worked towards included:Increasing academic research and experimentation on deliberative democratic practices and shape the agenda for that research and experimentation.  Expanding discussion of such experiments in scholarly work on deliberation and democracy.  Improving knowledge and understanding of how deliberative democratic institutions function, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of various models.  Increasing information about the outcomes of deliberative processes and highlight their value to various constituencies.  Developing better assessment tools.  Increasing interaction and communication amongst researchers and practitioners and develop an ongoing network among them. [5]FedNet  The FedNet (Federal Network) Task Group, also known as the Link to Government (LTG) group, convened federal officials from different countries to discuss ways of bringing together democratic deliberation and federal policy-making. The LTG was formed to identify opportunities and come up with strategies to promote and support citizen deliberation in government decision-making. The task group included representatives from the Centers for Disease Control, the EPA, and international organizations such as the Danish Board of Technology. The LTG worked to bring together civic engagement resources for elected officials and government agency practitioners. Their stated goals were to  (1) Champion deliberative democracy before government  (2) Build knowledge around existing practice  (3) Raise level of awareness within the DDC, elsewhere of government views and practice with regards to citizen engagement and deliberation.  (4) Raise level, quality of practice of deliberative democracy in government  To meet these objectives, the LTG developed specific proposals, which included:Developing a ""federal network for deliberation"" that shared information about the state of practice within various executive and legislative institutions.  Creating a ""best practices in deliberation"" award for federal managers and others.  Identifying research questions that are compelling for federal public participation practitioners. [6]Online DeliberationThe Online Deliberative Democracy Consortium (ODDC) was the DDC’s task group for supporting online innovation in the field of deliberation. Their mission was to build knowledge and track improvements made within the field of online deliberation. The ODDC created a number of online features, which include:Deliberative-democracy.net: the Internet’s number one destination for news about deliberative democracy. It receives 3,000-4,000 hits each month and is the second site to appear when the words “deliberative democracy” are searched on Google.  The d-d.net eBulletin: a monthly electronic newsletter that highlights recent activity in the field, distributed via email to more than 700 subscribers.  The Democracy Movement: a group blog maintained by more than a dozen leading scholars and practitioners in the field, that raises topics of interest related to democratic deliberation for discussion.  The FedNet wiki: provides a private network for federal government managers to develop a community of practice through online knowledge sharing and networking.  The Deliberative Democracy Handbook Online: a section of the d-d.net website dedicated entirely to the Handbook, providing chapter summaries, author bios, and discussion boards. [7]Online Deliberative Democracy Workgroup  Much of the DDC’s online activities were done through the Online Deliberative Democracy Workgroup (ODDW). This network of online deliberation leaders met monthly to talk about their recent activities and to come up with strategies to encourage online deliberation efforts around the world. In June 2005, the ODDW held a regional meeting in St. Paul, Minnesota, called “Deepening Online Deliberation Through Practice and Research.” The meeting was attended by state and local elected officials whom regarded it as highly productive. [8]Democratic Governance  Developed tools for leaders who are using deliberative strategies in their work. [9]Ongoing Projects and Events  The DDC partners have given assistance to hundreds of public involvement projects that have engaged hundreds of thousands of people in dialogue, deliberation, and problem-solving. Many of these projects have included young people, recent immigrants, and low-income people; those who are normally considered “hard to reach.” [10]  Past and ongoing projects include:Meetings and conferences such as the annual “Frontiers of Democracy” conference; special Researcher &amp; Practitioner meetings, and sessions at the annual conferences of the National League of Cities (NLC), International City and County Management Association (ICMA), National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation (NCDD), and many other associations.  Participatory innovations such as Text, Talk, and Act, a nationwide,  text-enabled , face-to-face discussion that has engaged thousands of young people in dialogue and action on issues of mental health, as part of President Obama’s  National Dialogue on Mental Health .  Participatory reforms such as the Model Ordinance on Public Participation and Model State Act on Public Participation, created by a working group (coordinated by DDC) that included the International Municipal Lawyers’ Association, American Bar Association, National Civic League, Policy Consensus Initiative, NLC, ICMA, and NCDD.

The IOPD is mainly focused on growing participatory government on the local scale with the aim of deepening the roots of democracy in municipal government.[1]  As an international network, the IOPD goes under several different names: Observatorio Internacional de la Democracia Participativa (OIDP),[2] Observatoire international de la démocratie participative (OIDP),[3] and Observatório Internacional da Democracia Participativa (OIDP).[4]  Origins and Development  The network was created in 2001 within the framework of the  European Commission ’s URB-AL programme for decentralized cooperation. It was officially constituted in November 2001 during the 1st Annual Conference of the IOPD in Barcelona, where their internal operating regulations were approved. Since 2006, the IOPD has coordinated with United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), mainly on the design of a joint framework of collaboration with the Committee on Social Inclusion and Participatory Democracy (CSIPD).  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The IOPD Presidency and the Technical Secretariat are the two basic internal bodies and are held by associates of the cities and local governments that belong to the IOPD network. Appointments to these posts are reached through  consensus  vote held at the annual assembly. The Presidency is held for one year and the winning candidate city must agree to host that year’s annual conference. The conference is hosted by a city on a different continent each year.  The General or Technical Secretariat post is held for 3 years and is renewable. The position has been held by the Barcelona City Council since the creation of the network.[5]  The Technical Secretariat carries out the daily work of the network, including management of the website and media library, preparation and publicisation of the IOPD initiatives and annual international conference. The Technical Secretariat is also the public face of the the IOPD, acting as the network’s representative and maintaining relations with the member institutions.[6]  The Coordinating Committee was created in 2004 to improve network efficiency. Comprising “the most active, committed associate and collaborating members of the network,” the committee meets several times a year, following up on projects and initiatives, and contributing proposals and suggestions for the improvement and development of the IOPD.[7]  In November 2011, a collaboration agreement was reached with the city of Porto Alegre to head the regional office of the OIDP for Latin America. This decentralisation of the organisation's structure was taken in an attempt to improve efficiency. In line with this need, the International Observatory for Participatory Democracy Platform for Africa was launched in Dakar on December 2012. Coordinated by ENDA-Ecopop, the platform focuses on local community initiatives, resources for participatory innovators, a forum for discussions on topics related to democratic governance, and online training and web conferencing.[8]  Established in 2001, the IOPD network now has over 800 members in 91 countries including towns, cities, associations, organisations, and research centres dedicated to the study and implementation of participatory democracy. There are no membership dues and membership is open to all who apply.[9]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Since 2011, the IOPD has focused its efforts on becoming a space for the production and exchange of knowledge around participatory democracy and good governance among the towns and cities that are party to the network. This work is largely carried out through its online repository of publications and case studies, annual conference, working groups, and ‘Best Practice in Citizens’ Participation’ Award. It is committed to diversifying the composition of its network and to decentralizing its structure in order to help identify, evaluate, and orient the development of participatory democracy in local contexts. The IOPD actively pursues collaboration and relationships with international organizations.[10]  Major Projects and Events  International Conference  Every year since its creation, the IOPD has held an international conference to advance discussions on participatory democracy and enable those attending to share experience and information in this field.[11]  IOPD Distinction for Good Practice in Citizen Participation  An award is given to recognize innovative experiences in participatory democracy that favour citizen participation and involvement in the preparation and implementation of public policies.[12]  Local Observatories on Participatory Democracy  In 2004, the IOPD undertook a project to create a network of “Local Observatories on Participatory Democracy” (LOPDs) to develop an evaluatory method for participation, informed by a wide variety of political, social, economic and regional perspectives. Ten LOPDs were established in Europe and Latin America. While the choice and development of the LOPDs’ goals and methodologies depended on the needs and characteristics of their social realities, their work was to be carried out with an eye to joint action. The project was carried out within the framework of the URB-AL Programme and concluded in April 2007.[13]  IOPD Work Groups  The definition of the IOPD work groups has taken shape within the framework of the annual conference. Reflection focuses on ways of promoting tools that strengthen democracy and give added impetus to the active participation of citizens in debates, designs, decisions, and the implementation of public policies. All interested IOPD members may participate in the work groups and contribute to them. Each group is coordinated by a city, which, with the support of the Technical Secretariat, is responsible for issuing framework documents on work to be carried out, collecting contributions from members and making the work group as dynamic as possible. One of the results of these work groups is the Local Observatories on Participatory Democracy project, which was originally included within the framework of the European Commission’s URB-AL programme for decentralized cooperation. Its main goal is to create local observatories in a number of European and Latin American cities to identify, evaluate and orient the development of different forms of participatory democracy and thereby to help direct the course of experiences that are under way.[14]  Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Demos' vision is a democracy of free citizens, with an equal stake in society. They search for and communicate ideas to give people more power to shape their own lives.  Their work is animated by four themes:  Capabilities  Personal resources – such as skills, character, health and material resources - deeply affect people's ability to shape their own lives. Their programme of work on capabilities focus on the skills and traits people need to lead a fulfilled and autonomous life and how families, communities and schools can support children and young people in developing them.  Independence  Institutions can sap power by narrowing choice and cultivating dependency. They should be built on the presumption that power belongs with individuals rather than professionals. To live freely and independently – to be able choose our own path through life – is a goal of open, democratic societies.  Citizenship  Individuals belonging to a community are inter-dependent, so decisions about the shared conditions of life must be taken together. Active citizenship underpins a free, open and fair society but inequality inhibits their ability to participate fully. Broader, more flexible definitions of citizenship will be needed to foster a healthier civil society.  Security  Security underpins our everyday lives. While the primary duty of government is the safety of its citizens and the protection of the national interest, the range and complexity of security issues is forcing us to revaluate existing approaches and policies. In doing so their focus is shifting away from the state and exploring the role of the individual.Origins and DevelopmentOrganizational Structure, Membership, and FundingSpecializations, Methods and ToolsMajor Projects and EventsAlongside and connected with the four themes, which form the cornerstones of Demos work programme, they are also running a series of projects with a particular focus, including Culture, Progressive Conservatism and The Future of Capital.Analysis and Lessons LearnedPublicationsSee AlsoNanodialogues Public Engagement on Nanotechnology (UK)ReferencesExternal LinksDemosDemos limited, registered charity no. 1042046Notes  ",1,0,0,6,0,,Demos is a UK based cross party think tank which specialises in social policy and evidence based solutions.

Essential Partners fosters communication and understanding of where each person is coming from in order to create human relationships and tolerance with even those who might have opinions and ideas from the opposite spectrum.[3] [4] As well, the organization hopes to make people realize that those that might have been considered adversaries prior to their trained dialogues, can now work with each other toward a shared goal.[5]  Essential Partners works with people from all sides of the world in order to truly bond everything from universities, other non-profit organizations, community groups, government agencies, faith communities, issue advocates, professionals in mediation and dispute resolution and private citizens.[6] They believe that it’s possible to bring any two people together and create a conversation of substance that will allow individuals to understand that together they can reach an area of common ground.[7]  Origins and Development  Family therapist and philanthropist Laura Chasin conceived the idea in 1989.[8] After witnessing a debate on abortion on television, Chasin began to question how family therapy practices could improve polarizing conversations about abortion or other intense public issues.[9] Essential Partners was founded the same year under the name 'The Public Conversations Project', but did not enter the public’s eye until a shooting in 1994 where a man named “John Salvi walked into the Planned Parenthood clinic in Brookline and opened fire with a rifle”, seriously wounding three people and killing the receptionist.[10] Salvi then went on to drive two miles down Beacon Street to Preterm Health Services where he injured two more people and killed another receptionist.[11] This violent incident caused the already substantial divide between those that were pro-life and those that were pro-choice to grow even larger, but it was because of this incident that three people who are prominent figures from both sides decided it was necessary to sit down and have a civilized conversation in order to prevent incidents like this from occurring again.  These six people went to Essential Partners and met in private using the organization's method of communicating.[12] They learned about each other as people, started to care for one another, and realized the power and personal effect of vocabulary.[13] Through Essential Partners' methods and techniques of dialogue and communication, they were able to mend the gap in a way where they could be civil to one another and respect one another’s ideas and concerns.[14] The article ""Talking with the Enemy"", published in The Boston Globe, showed the public what had been happening in secrecy and really brought people’s attention to Essential Partners as an organization that created constructive dialogues about all different conflicts.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Essential Partners' members provide “training, facilitation, coaching, and consultation” to communities and other organizations that wish to work with them.[15] Fixed in Boston, they often travel outside the city to communities that request their assistance.[16]It wasn’t until 1996 when they received an initial grant from William and Flora Hewlett Foundation that PCP became a nonprofit organization.[18] Having Essential Partners become a non-profit organization means that they are always interested in foundations funding and supporting their vision. The organization has been fortunate enough to have many different foundations fund their organization in order to continue bringing people together. Some foundations that have been interested in their work include The Boston Foundation, United States Institute of Peace, Rockefeller Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation and many more. Essential Partners began life as 'the Public Conversations Project', a Family Institute of Cambridge-funded initiative.[17]Aside from receiving funding from foundations, Essential Partners, also accepts donations from individuals or other organizations that feel that what the organization has done is useful and right for not only the country but also the world.  Specializations, Methods, and Tools  While Essential Partners' underlying philosophy or 'theory of change' is not entirely unique, its innovative methods, tools, and techniques of communication have seen success in the creation of constructive,  sustained dialogues . The way Essential Partners' staff facilitates and teaches people how to communicate with one another has roots in family systems therapy methods and goals. The goal with using family therapist skills is to prevent people from seeing each other as enemies but to see each other through personal experiences and deeper understandings. Their goal is not to change people’s minds or make the group come out with one answer to the problem, but more so to have people come out with respect for the other side and understanding of where each person is coming from. They hope to make connections between people that before would have assumed there was no way to relate to someone with such an opposing view. They, like many other organizations, wish to promote public  deliberation , thereby encouraging participation in democracy through their methods of constructive conversations.[19] Although public deliberation typically is more based around decision-making, Essential Partners does not intend for the group to come out with a decision, but to instead come out more enlightened.  Essential Partners has three methods in order to provide productive dialogue. First, it takes preventative measures in order to guarantee that the conversation won’t turn into a debate. All those that intend to participate in the conversation are contacted before and are asked to listen to some ground rules, such as not talking over one another and waiting till the facilitator has asked you a question.[20] This is to ensure that no one in the group gets attacked, or feels as though they must put their guard up and not truly say how they feel. Secondly, Essential Partners has a variety of facilitative processes such as keeping the conversation on track, asking the questions, setting the tone of the interactions and conversation and enforcing the ground rules.[21] Lastly, Essential Partners works with the participants in creating the overall process such as the ground rules.[22] They allow the participants to work together to realize what rules should be instituted in order to avoid offense.[23] This is the beginning of showing the group what things affect what people and making everyone more conscious of even the little things. The point of these three steps is to get the participants to realize that in no shape or form are they there to try to change people’s mind or to prove that they are right. The aim is for everyone to share experiences and talk about who they are in order to really show each other what it’s like in their shoes.  Major Projects and Events  Essential Partners has led many major projects and events relating to dialogue, communications, and conflict resolution. Emblematic of its work is a 2017 project to diffuse the polarizing rhetoric of journalistic reporting on the Isreali-Palestinian conflict. Like the majority of Essential Parterns' other work, the project brought both sides of the conflict together in dialogue. Five Israeli and five Palestinian journalists engaged in a series of dialogue workshops around the challenges of reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.[24] The hope was that through the dialogue workshop, the participants would gain better understanding of each other’s experiences and constraints.[25] This project demonstrates Essential Partners committment to the use of deliberation in conflict resolution and management in America and abroad. Besides international conflict, Essential Partners has brought people together around issues like health care, higher education and various matters of public policy.[26]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  With their unique methodology and powerful theory of change, Essential Partners has proven the ability for dialogue to resolve conflict and build mutual understanding. The Essential Partners organization as a non-profit and non-partisan entity, has grown to become a place where people of all sides can be heard and valued for who they are.[27] The organization continues to show people that just because a person may think one way they have the ability to listen to the other side comfortably, professionally and honorably without creating hatred and fear. It is likely for this reason that they have been asked to work with all different types of groups from universities to community groups.[28] Essential Partners serves many different groups from all different backgrounds in order to get one thing out of it for them, which is a chance to genuinely communicate.[29] Since Essential Partners has become seen as an organization with a lot of power to bring people together, they have been working on projects to expand not just in America but also around the world.  Publications  Essential Partners, formerly the Public Conversations Project, has been mentioned in the news all around the country in order to make people aware of what is going on and what the organization has to offer.[30] Some of the most famous publications of PCP include an article from Newsday where an Associate named Mary Jacksteit answered questions about how she would be able to help resolve the conflicts over abortion and health care reform.[31] Answering these kinds of questions in the news allows the public to see the methods that Essential Partners uses and the successes Essential Partners has the ability to have. Furthermore, PCP has been mentioned in articles discussing how two very opposite sides have had the ability to talk and communicate with one another and how these polarized sides have come to PCP with the hope that they can someday understand one another and reach some form of common ground. When the  National Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation  [32] asked on their website, ncdd.org, which programs have addressed the partisan divide in the U.S. through dialogue, deliberation and conflict resolution, PCP was mentioned and recommended for this very cause.[33]  See AlsoNational Coalition for Dialogue and Deliberation   References  [1] [2] “About us.”  Public Conversations ,  http://publicconversations.org/about-us#sthash.BofRYBL1.dpuf  [dead link]  [3] Alison Baron and Mary Jacksteit. “Public Conversations Project Dialogue.”  Civicus , accessed January 30, 2019,  https://www.civicus.org/documents/toolkits/PGX_D_Public%20Conversations.pdf , 1  [4] “About us.”  Essential Partners,  accessed January 30, 2019,  https://www.whatisessential.org/about-us[5] Alison Baron and Mary Jacksteit. “Public Conversations Project Dialogue.”  Civicus , accessed January 30, 2019,  https://www.civicus.org/documents/toolkits/PGX_D_Public%20Conversations.pdf , 1.

They work to advance innovative and powerful ways for the public to engage in the democratic process and improve political discourse.  They work on in-depth and fair  deliberations , both in-person and online, in order to build meaningful new ways for the public to weigh in on the important issues.Origins and DevelopmentHealthy Democracy grew out of the successful work of their sister organization, Healthy Democracy Oregon, to promote an innovative reform of the ballot initiative process. This reform, called the  Citizens’ Initiative Review  (CIR), presents voters with clear, useful, and trustworthy evaluations of statewide ballot measures. Since 2009, Healthy Democracy has led efforts to develop and refine the  Citizens’ Initiative Review process for use by Oregon voters .  In June, 2011, the Oregon legislature approved House Bill 2634, legislation making the Citizens’ Initiative Review a permanent part of Oregon elections. Oregon is now the first state in the nation to adopt this innovative policy into law. This marked the first time a legislature has made voter deliberation a formalized part of the election process. The CIR is a benchmark in the initiative reform and public engagement fields.  House Bill 2634 also created a commission to oversee and conduct the Citizens’ Initiative Review (CIR) in Oregon. The CIR Commission is the official authority on how the CIR works, how it is administered, and what measures are selected for review. Healthy Democracy was selected by the newly formed Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review Commission to run two Reviews during the 2012 election cycle — the first official state CIRs.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and ToolsHealthy Democracy focuses on the  Citizens’ Initiative Review , a way of publicly evaluating ballot measures so that voters have clear, useful, and trustworthy information at election time.  During the Citizens’ Initiative Review, a panel of randomly-selected and demographically-balanced voters is brought together from across the state to fairly evaluate a ballot measure. The panel hears directly from advocates for and against the measure and calls upon policy experts during the multi-day public review. For each measure reviewed, a new panel is convened. At the conclusion of each review, panelists draft a ‘Citizens’ Statement’ highlighting the most important findings about the measure. Each ‘Citizens’ Statement’ is published as a prominent page in the voters’ pamphlet as a new and easily accessible resource for voters to use at election time.Major Projects and EventsThe CIR was adopted into Oregon Law during the 2011 session of the Oregon Legislature.

 The Pew Center was an incubator for civic journalism experiments that enable news organizations to create and refine better ways of reporting the news to re-engage people in public life. It operated from 1993 to 2002. J-Lab, its successor project, archives its projects and publications, and maintains its website and its executive director, Jan Schaffer, now heads the Institute for Interactive Journalism. 
 The Pew Center for Civic Journalism's mission was to serve as ""an incubator for civic journalism experiments that enable news organizations to create and refine better ways of reporting the news to re-engage people in public life."" 
 Origins and Development 
 The Pew Center for Civic Journalism was established by The Pew Charitable Trusts to promote community involvement in local politics. 
 Organizational Structure and Funding 
 The governing structure, The Pew Charitable Trusts, was headquartered in Pennsylvania, and invested in various experiments of civic journalism. In the year 2000 alone, the Trusts awarded $230 million to 302 nonprofit organizations aimed to foster civic journalism. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 The Center assisted media outlets in finding new ways to report the news that will engage local communities and citizens in decision-making and problem resolution. 
 In addition to its many partnerships, The Center also conducted civic journalism experiments within the journalism community through workshops, publications, videos, and various outreach programs. The Pew Center shared the results of its experiments with the journalism professions through its: James K. Batten Awards for Excellence in Civic Journalism, Funding for Civic Journalism Projects, Workshops, Spotlights. Publications, Videos. Quarterly Civic Catalyst Newsletters, Presentations, and other outreach. According to the Pew Center's website, over 3,520 journalists have attended their workshops, 10,000 receive their quarterly newsletter, and 226 news organizations have participated in initiatives that were facilitated through the Center. Civic JournalismThe Pew Center for Civic Journalism strived to create media pieces that incorporate the public more in the information-gathering process. Civic Journalism makes an effort to portray how citizens view their social issues as well as what they think of as possible solutions. Journalists then utilize that information in creating a more personal, engaging broadcast or newspaper report. Civic Journalism is growing in popularity by many organizations. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 Significant partnerships in the past have included those with the Radio and Television news Directors Foundation, IRE, The Maynard Institute, NPR, PBS's Democracy Project, The Kettering Foundation, National Association of Black Journalists and the Association for Education in journalism and Mass Communications. The project is administered by The Tides Center of San Francisco. Civic Journalism ExperimentsThe Pew Center for Civic Journalism invested in various experiments in the field of journalism in hope of allowing organizations to express themselves in a non-traditional way, and therefore, involving the public in non-traditional journalistic ways. Since the organization was founded, the Center has assisted with over 120 initiatives that seek to provide the everyday citizen with a voice in how their news is covered. By doing this, the public is encouraged to share what they believe are problems, and then deliberate on solutions - making them more active citizens. 
 The Center supported projects concerning public engagement, quality of life, elections, race relations, crime, economy, youth/children, education, citizenship and governance. 
 One of their projects that received a significant amount of media attention as well as a notable increase in civil engagement is one called The Citizens Election Project. This project took place during the elections of 1995/1996 and consisted of over five media partnerships and focused on the ""crucial states:"" California, Iowa, New Hampshire and Florida. 
 Case studies of The Citizens Election Project included: ""Voice of the people, Iowa"" 
 Iowa: ""Students and the Caucuses"" 
 Derry, New Hampshire: ""The People's Voice"" 
 New Hampshire: ""Voters' Voice"" 
 San Francisco: ""Voice of the Voter"" 
 ""Voices of Florida""

PASOK is one of the two leading political parties in Greece and tends to be centre-left in ideology.Origins and DevelopmentPASOK was created in response to the collapse of the military dictatorship in Greece in 1974. Its founder, Andreas Papandreou, founded PASOK on the ideals of National Independence, Popular Sovereignty, Social Emancipation, and Democratic Process.  PASOK’s presence in Grecian government became prominent in its early years. By November 1977 elections, just three years after being established, PASOK had doubled its share of votes and won 92 seats, becoming the main opposition party. PASOK won 173 seats by 1981 and formed the first socialist government in Greece since 1924.  From 1985 – 1993 PASOK experienced extreme policy changes and financial and corruption scandals, which led to it’s brief decline in governmental influence. By 1995 Papandreou led PASOK to a landslide victory and regained control of the Grecian government.  In 1996 Papandreou was forced to step down due to his ailing health and was succeeded by Costas Simitis. Simitis started the pro-European wing of PASOK, and was accredited to modernizing PASOK. Yet, his lack of opinion and action of the Imia crisis caused him to have a flawed image by the Grecian people. In a time of Athens hosting the Olympics and terrorist attacks, PASOK lost its traditional appeal to the Greek lower and middle classes, resulting in a loss of elections in 2004. The New Democracy party had taken over from 2004 until 2009 when PASOK, now led by George Papandreou, finally regained election.IdeologyWhen founded PASOK was a social democratic party. Under Andreas Papandreou’s leadership, wages were increased and capital gains were taxed. When PASOK became under the power of Kostas Simitis there was significantly tighter fiscal policies, private state enterprises, and a broadening tax base. Shifting from its original principles, PASOK is now shifting the tax base, cutting salaries in both private and public sectors, and cutting social welfare. PASOK still defines their party as a social democracy.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingSpecializations, Methods and ToolsMajor Projects and EventsAnalysis and Lessons LearnedPublicationsSee AlsoMarousi, Greece - Deliberative PollingReferences  ""Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK).""

Democracy doesn’t just stop after a general election. It’s everywhere, every day.  The problem was that citizens either didn’t know how to access it, or had to jump through so many hoops to take part that it just wasn’t worth their time. Delib looks at democratic processes that aren’t functioning properly, and design digital products that make them work for an internet age.  Delib's products are in use by over 160 organisations around the world, primarily concentrated in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. [1]Origins and DevelopmentSince its inception in 2001, this firm has been one of the top digital democracy companies in the field. Throughout their existence, their clientele has included central governments such as that of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as well as central government departments, local authorities of varying size and scope, health bodies, regulators, and other publicly accountable bodies.[2]Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingDelib is a for-profit company that offers its products on an annual subscription basis. Organisations can choose to use one, two or all three, depending on their individual needs and plans for citizen engagement. As such there is no membership available.  Delib is a small company with about 30 employees. Its HQ is located in Bristol, England, but it also has staff in Australia, New Zealand, and Scotland.FundingThis organization is a for-profit company and they work with various organizations and governments. The cost of each tool is charged annually on a subscription basis. Some examples of partners they have worked with and for include:NHS, BBC Trust, Defra, European Parliament, NAPA, DoH, Cabinet Office, Bristol City Council, London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, and the Scottish Government.  ToolsCitizen Space:Citizen Space is a democratic involvement platform that is most commonly used for statutory and non-statutory consultation and stakeholder engagement. It supports the end-to-end process of public involvement: from the design and creation of the response mechanism through data collection to final feedback and response publishing.  This online consultation platform has been  used by the Scottish Government .Simulator:This product makes it easier for people to understand complex decisions, such as budgets, policing priorities and climate obligations, enabling informed opinions on the issue in question. Simulator allows weighted resource allocation and priority-setting that begins to reproduce the conditions government officials face in their own decision-making. The tool informs at the point of response, meaning that participants need no prior knowledge of e.g. council finances to take part. [3]Dialogue:This product allows for the sharing of ideas,  online  dynamic interaction and the gathering of customer feedback. It is ideal for  crowd-sourcing ; promoting innovation and ideas exchange; and running debates on issues that your community cares about. This application has been used by the White House and the Department of Homeland Security to get people involved in important discussions. [4]Major Projects and EventsCase Studies  Delib is dedicated to helping their clients excel in their efforts of engaging with the public. Through previous case studies, Delib has been successful in developing consultations that connect government departments and local organizations with regular citizens. Delib has developed a strategy for their case studies which consists of the brief, the work, the results and finally, how to find out more information.1. Barnet, Enfield and Haringey PCTSThey have worked with Barnet, Enfield and Haringey PCTS, which are three hospitals that are interested in providing better qualified local doctors and better building for their patients to enjoy. BE&amp;H is interested in engaging and consulting local citizens about health care issues that are most sensitive. Delib managed a bespoke  e-consultation  campaign which received a lot of community engagement. The number of participants reached over 10,000 and hundreds of responses to the  surveys  conducted.2. Macmillan Cancer Support CenterWith the use of an 'Idea Tree,' Delib was able to manage a successful campaign with MCSC. Macmillan cancer support center is dedicated to helping people whose lives have been affected by cancer. They wanted to build engagement and research how people think cancer should look like in 2016. They developed an idea tree which helped people read, rate, and submit ideas for improving the ordeal involved with cancer. Essentially an effort to push for better cancer care for patients and their families, the number of participants reached over 26,000 and the submitting of more than 250 ideas.[7]3. Torbay CouncilOne of the other case studies was with Torbay Council which is Unitary Authority[8]; their goal was to allow Torbay citizens to be involved in the budget setting process and make their priorities known to council decision-makers. Delib created a budget simulator that is a customizable tool to help with consultation and prioritizing local issues. Responses were numbered in more than 1,000 Torbayian residents.4. DefraThe Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs is a government department in the UK. [9] Their desired results were to “ Raise awareness and encourage attitudinal change amongst 11-16 year olds about the urgent need to tackle climate change.” Delib helped them by building “my adobo” which is an online tool that helps people shape a house to suit them, when they are done, they can shape the climate. Over 138,000 visited the site to see the impacts of customizable virtual houses and their effects on the climate. This resulted in over 32,000 adobos being created.5. National Dialogue on Health Care, IT and Privacy for the National Academy of Public AdministrationThey were interested in hearing about ideas and opinions of stakeholders as well as Americans on the issue of healthcare. With help from Delib, they were able to develop an 'opinion tracker' which is an online database that allows people to share their intelligent thoughts while others are able to listen and make-sense of the thousands of voices all going on at once. The results were outstanding because the opinion tracker received over 2800 visitors a week and submitted over 120 unique ideas and more than 500 comments on those ideas.6. London Borough of Hammersmith and FulhamThe final case study was for London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. They are a council that is dedicated to helping residents and businesses during rough times.[10] LBHF wanted to deliver “deliver a full online consultation and stakeholder/public engagement web system to support the authority's consultation work.” The customized version of Delib’s e-consultation platform was the tool LBHF was most interested in. This online database includes a finder database, survey tool, stakeholder communication system, and reporting and management tools. This was a huge success because everyone had an opportunity to engage in discussions. In the end, more than 2,000 residents responded to online surveys.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

By elevating a diversity of voices, forging common ground, and improving dialogue and collaboration among leaders and communities, Public Agenda fuels progress on critical issues, including education, health care and community engagement. Founded in 1975, Public Agenda is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization based in New York City.  Origins and Development  Public Agenda was founded in 1975 by social scientist and author, Daniel Yankelovich, and United States Secretary of State, Cyrus Vance. For over 35 years, Public Agenda has aimed to fulfill two main missions: for American leaders to better understand the public's point of view, and for citizens to know more about critical policy issues so they can make thoughtful, informed decisions.  PublicAgenda.org has been nominated twice for the prestigious Webby Award as one of the Internet's best sources for balanced, accurate information on public policy issues. It has participated with many different communities and partnered with many organizations to better inform the nation, so citizens and leaders can make higher quality decisions on public issues.  Organizational Structure and Funding  Public Agenda is funded by multiple major organizations. Some grants are designated for specific projects.Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation - Promotes greater equity in global health, education, public libraries, and support for at-risk families in Washington State and Oregon  Carnegie Corporation of New York - Created by Andrew Carnegie in 1911 to promote ""the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding.""

Kellogg Foundation - Focuses on improving current and future communities' quality of life in the United States, Latin America, Caribbean, and southern Africa.Specializations, Methods and Tools  The following has been adapted from ""Our Approach"" on  the Public Agenda website  :  Public Agenda helps build a democracy that works for everyone and fuels progress on critical issues through:1. Research that illuminates people's views and valuesPublic Agenda conducts nuanced and in-depth opinion research, based on co-founder Dan Yankelovich's Learning Curve perspective. This research enables the organization to understand where stakeholders are coming from, what they think and why. In turn, it helps leaders and stakeholders grasp:how others are thinking and talking about a problem  the sorts of solutions they are currently willing to support  how to effectively engage them in problem solving2. Engagement that gets people talking, learning from each other and working together on solutions.Public Agenda's engagement work is propelled by their research and based on decades practice. Through careful issue framing, nonpartisan Choicework discussion guides, well-designed dialogue, expert facilitation and skillful reporting, Public Agenda helps people build common ground, despite their differences.  The organization's Community Conversation model for public engagement offers an alternative to traditional and often unproductive public forums. Community Conversations provide government officials and community leaders an opportunity to engage a broad cross section of a community in productive, action-oriented deliberation.3. Techniques for managing the human side of change.Often, earnest attempts to make a good decision and solve a problem are derailed when it comes time to make necessary changes. Change is always bumpy, but Public Agenda helps improve the implementation and sustainability of reform through additional research and engagement techniques that address the human side of change.4. A capacity building ethos.Public Agenda strengthens the capacity of community members, organizational and institutional leaders, and other stakeholders to continue and expand the work they do. Public Agenda works closely with stakeholders to develop tailored and flexible tools, provide training and assistance, and share knowledge of lessons learned.5. Communications that build momentum for change.Through approachable and readable reports, regular commentary, social media, and presentations, podcasts and webinars, Public Agenda shares what they're doing and learning to help others across the nation and worldwide work together toward solutions.  Major Projects and Events  Public Agenda is associated with many different public engagement projects and community forums to help the nation’s citizens come together to better deliberate and collaborate on difficult issues.  One of the projects was the Citizen Engagement And Community Transformation in Bridgeport, CT. In 1996, the Bridgeport Public Education Fund (BPEF) joined a national demonstration project led by Public Agenda and the Institute for Educational Leadership (IEL) to explore possibilities for public dialogue about education reform among diverse stakeholders.  In the spring of 2004, Public Agenda participated in the Nebraskans Weigh in on Essential Educational Opportunities for All Students. The Nebraska State Board of Education was looking for a way to allow a cross-section of residents to weigh in on the recommendations they had developed and laid out in a document called Equitable Opportunities For an Essential Education For All Students-Recommendations for Nebraska Public School Districts.Public Agenda had helped the state board connected hundreds of Nebraskans to discuss the controversial question of statewide standards. Parents, students, educators and community members participated in Choicework discussion forums where they wrestled with various approaches to the standards issue. Building off the results of these discussions, the state board was able to adopt new statewide guidelines. In the end, Public Agenda conducted focus groups and helped selected districts facilitate discussion forums with more than 370 parents, students, educators (teachers, principals and superintendents) and members of the general public that represented roughly 25 districts.  In 2004, Public Agenda conducted fieldwork in New Haven, Connecticut; San Antonio, Texas; and New York City, which was support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the New York Community Trust. This project was called the Straight Talk/Street Talk: Possibilities for Dialogue Between Communities and the Police. They interviewed numerous law enforcement officials, from patrol officers to upper brass, and held 12 focus groups with various kinds of residents. They also developed four new Choicework guides (Preventing Crime, Promoting Public Safety; Improving Police-Community Relations; Ensuring School Safety and Preventing Terrorism and Protecting Civil Liberties) that were used to structure five dialogue sessions held across the three sites.  In September 2003 Public Agenda launched the project of Addressing Property Tax Reform in New Jersey. Public Agenda helped the Coalition for the Public Good, a New Jersey based grass-roots organization, to organize and conducted a major statewide ""Citizen's Tax Assembly,"" a two-day event held in the capitol building in Trenton.  The New Jersey Citizens' Tax Assembly  brought together close to 100 diverse ""delegates"" from every county in the state to engage one another in a dialogue on possible approaches to tax reform.  Public Agenda helped in creating a different kind of forum in which residents from across the state could engage complex questions of tax reform and reveal that reasonable solutions are possible. Public Agenda carried out focus groups with Anglo parents, bilingual Hispanic parents, Spanish-only Hispanic parents, students of various backgrounds, and teachers on the topics of student achievement, diversity, and equity, for the Standards in San Jose, California project. One district official called the findings ""an eye-opening experience"" because parents of all backgrounds, along with students themselves, called for high expectations for student achievement. In response, the school board raised its graduation requirements. The district then moved on to a broad-based community conversation about ""Standards and Expectations for Our Students"" with Public Agenda assisting by training conversation organizers and moderators, and by developing discussion materials. Although the district initiated and sponsored the forum, a committee that included parents, members of the clergy, employers and others took over the planning and operations. The forum, held at a downtown church, drew about 140 participants; some discussions were conducted in Spanish with translated materials and a bilingual moderator and recorder. The National School Public Relations Association awarded the district a top award for its public engagement model.  In the 1990's research commissioned by the Graustein Memorial Fund in Connecticut and conducted by Public Agenda revealed significant gaps between the general public, community leaders and educators concerning the problems facing Connecticut's schools, which resulted to the Changing the Conversation on Education in Connecticut project. To kick off the project, hundreds of organizations--school districts, parent groups, community-based organizations, etc., were invited to participate. Initially, eight local sponsors were chosen, covering 17 towns. By design, they were to work as a network to build statewide capacity for civic dialogues on the range of issues facing Connecticut's schools. Each site was funded and received technical assistance from Public Agenda. Since then, over 70 cities and towns across the state have participated and the initiative continues to grow.

Its  aims include abolishing barriers which seem to restrict access to direct democracy in Austria as well as guaranteeing free access to media.  According to the current legal situation, referendums must be passed and approved with a simple or two-thirds majority in the National Council. In this case, therefore, it cannot be said that the law proceeds from the people. The citizens elect the members of the National Council every four (in future five) years, but then have no way of initiating votes themselves. Only the so-called referendum is reserved to them, the result of which, however, is not mandatory.  Switzerland is a pioneer of direct democracy. The Swiss have referendums as soon as 100,000 signatures have been collected. It has been shown there that direct democracy has led to greater closeness to the citizen, trust in politics and stability.  Thus, a primary concern of the organization is to give the population the opportunity to initiate referendums themselves to ensure citizen involvement in the development process and in the question of a referendum. In Mehr Demokratie's view, the instruments of direct democracy should not replace representative democracy, but complement it.  Origins and Development  The organization existed since the beginning of 2006 and is independent from any political party.  In Austria, there are some laws which regulate direct democracy and we have different types of referendums. On the one hand, the so called “Volksbegehren” which has been held 32 times since 1964 has only limited effects. The parliament has to discuss the result and is not obliged to pass a new law. This kind of referendum can be initiated by 8023 citizens.  On the other hand, there is a “Volksabstimmung” whose results oblige the parliament to pass a new law. This type of referendum must be permitted by the parliament or the state president and has only been proceeded twice in Austria after the second world war. That kind of referendum cannot be initiated by the citizens.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  A non-partisan, nonprofit organization, Mehr Demokratie Austria is financed exclusively by donations that are not tied to any conditions.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  In addition to their focus on referendums, media laws are a focus of the organization based on the notion that they are necessary to ensure that citizens are informed in a balanced way when voting. Political television advertising for elections or voting campaigns is not permitted in Switzerland. In Austria, political parties happily advertise and politicians attend rhetoric courses. Mehr Demokratie advocates for open discussion programs instead of targeted propaganda.  The organization uses the potential of the Internet for our activities.

The Council was formed in the 1950s after the Supreme Court outlawed school segregation in  Brown v. Board of Education . Under the leadership of  Robert B. Patterson , the Citizens' Council was formed on July 11, 1954, to resist desegregation. It was started in Indianola, MS, and expanded to other states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Missouri. It attracted middle to upper-class civilians, most of them politicians, doctors, lawyers, teachers, bankers, and businessmen. The Citizens’ Council lasted approximately 25 years, from 1954 – 1979. [1]Unlike the  Ku Klux Klan  and other racist groups during the  civil rights movement , the Citizens' Council was not rooted in violence. Instead, the Citizens' Council focused on using economic, social and political pressures to oppress African Americans and supporters. While common stereotypes often portray racism to be behavior exemplified by the working and uneducated class, the Citizens’ Council showed that racism is also practiced by educated, upper class citizens. Characterized by their fear of miscegenation, the Citizens’ Council chronicled an important time in American history when it was not a law, but the people themselves that restricted each other from achieving civil rights. As Earl Johnson, a former member of the Citizens’ Council writes, “...it looked like to me that the Citizens' Council was just stirring up hate among whites and really was accomplishing nothing except just building an organization of members paying dues.” [2]  The Citizens' Council monitored all aspects of life in the Deep South with the aid of  Jim Crow laws  hoping to retain the status quo prior to the move towards integration. They heavily influenced outcomes of elections, health care policies, economic sanctions and progress, school districts, and other agenda.Origins and DevelopmentOn May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that “in the field of public education, the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate but unequal education facilities are inherently unequal.”  [3]  The Court further ruled that segregation in any public place was unequal. This proclamation for integration was celebrated by black Americans everywhere, but in the South it was received with skepticism. Known infamously as "" Black Monday ”, Southern whites were greatly concerned with the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision, and many felt the threat of this change in status quo. Mississippi Senator  James O. Eastland  said, ""On May 17, 1954, the Constitution of the United States was destroyed because of the Supreme Court's decision. You are not obliged to obey the decisions of any court which are plainly fraudulent [and based on] sociological considerations.”  [4]The first Citizens’ Council meeting was held in a living room in  Indianola, Mississippi  on July 11, 1954. Robert “Tut” Patterson, a plantation manager, led the chapter. Attendance was approximately 100 people, including the town mayor and civic attorney. By August 1955, membership in the Citizens’ Council had exceeded 60,000 people, and included 253 Councils. In August 1956, the Citizens’ Council had expanded to 30 states to form the  Citizens’ Council of America , with the goal to preserve the “natural” rights of racial segregation and the “maintenance of our States’ Rights to regulate public health, morals, marriage, education, peace and good order in the States, under the Constitution of the United States.” Membership for the Citizens’ Councils peaked at 250,000 in 1957. The Citizens’ Council of America had an influential board of advisors, including Senator James O. Eastland and Representative John Bell Williams of Mississsippi, Senator J. Strom Thurmond and Representative L. Mendel of South Carolina, and Governor Marvin Griffin of Georgia.  [1]In April 1957, a fifteen-minute telecast, “Forum” began its weekly broadcast over WLBT-TV in Jackson. Telecasts were shown by twelve stations across Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia, and radio tapes were broadcasted over fifty stations in the South. In 1962, the Civil Rights Act practically all but destroyed the Citizens’ Council’s work as racial integration became more widely popular. That September 29, President Kennedy federalized Mississippi National Guard troops to force integration at the  University of Mississippi  (Ole Miss).  [4]The Sovereignty Commission  announced on October 19, 1964 that monthly payments to the telecast “Forum” would be reduced from $4,500 to $2,000. Viewer attention started to dwindle, and by December 1964, only a few stations in Mississippi and neighboring states still regularly played “Forum” programs. This decline can be explained through a number of factors, but mostly Southerners grew wary of upholding such strict traditions in an era of forward and progressive thinking. As African Americans started to gain political, economic, and social status, businesses could no longer deny services to African Americans. Political leaders and other community officials started to liberalize towards integration, and the balance shifted favorably towards civil rights in the South. The social cultural change was generally accepted by Southern citizens, who became reluctant to associate with racist groups that were being condemned by the rest of the nation.  By the 1970s, support had drastically diminished for the Citizens’ Councils. There was a brief revival in 1985 when a new group emerged dedicated to preserving the privileges of white America, The  Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) . The CCC was founded in St. Louis, MO in 1985 by leaders in the Citizens’ Council, including Robert Patterson. However, like the Citizens’ Councils, the CCC held extremist views of white supremacy and white separatism by promoting “the interests of European Americans”.  [5]Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe majority of funding came from members themselves, who paid dues every meeting. The Citizens' Councils especially attracted wealthy members of society. Membership was open to anyone who fit the correct description: white, powerful, and racist. Members paid dues and attended weekly meetings in local homes, courthouses, schools, and other locations. A typical meeting in Mississippi is described by Erle Johnston, former director of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission: “Big speaker [would] get up and say, ‘We're not going to let the federal government do so-and-so. We are not going to do so-and-so. Come on. Bring your money up here. Let's join. Give us your money.’ So people would give their money and leave there, and they would feel better, like an emotional purgative, even though no plan had been adopted; no course had been assumed.”  [2]The other way to receive revenue was from the publicly-funded  Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission , an agency that promoted segregation. In 1956, the Mississippi legislature formed the State Sovereignty Commission. The Sovereignty Commission contributed generous funds to the Citizens’ Council, and also offered their investigation through a covert network that tracked blacks and whites.  [1]  The Citizens’ Council did not keep specific records, but speculation estimates its annual budget in 1956 to be around 400,000 in Mississippi alone. William J. Simmons estimated the budget to have fallen to around 200,000 by 1963.  As Southern blacks began their civil rights movement through boycotts, protests, and other forms of revolt, Southern whites also began their own form of resistance. When Southern blacks boycotted the bus system in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955, the Citizens’ Council gained an exponential increase of membership. Southern blacks were evicted by landlords, fired by employers, denied credit by merchants, refused service, and assaulted. Other members worked to prevent African American voters from rolls, threatened to fire employees who registered to vote or integrate public facilities, and foreclosed businesses and farms.  [6]Present Day  Today, the  Council of Conservative Citizens  (CCC) continues to exist, and is headquartered in St. Louis, MO. They follow a “Statement of Principles,” written by  Dr. Samuel Francis , the former editor of the Citizens’ Informer newspaper and a member of the CCC National Board of Directors. The “Statement of Principles” begins with a declaration: “The American men and women who make up the Council of Conservative Citizens believe in, commit themselves to, and pledge to work for and support these fundamental principles of American civilization, liberty, justice, and national safety.”  [5] A list of 14 points detail the United States as a Christian country, the preservation of European peoples in the United States, as well as specific policies on family, the environment, national and state law. CCC has chapter sites in Alabama, California, Mississippi, and the Carolinas, and also European allies, including the  British National Party ,  Vlaams Belang  (in Flanders, Belgium), and  Front National  (in France). Members of the CCC describe themselves as “the country’s most effective conservative activist group.” The group publishes a newspaper, The Citizens’ Informer, that is delivered quarterly. Each issue contains a section called “Council News”, which contains events happening in local chapters. CCC can also be heard on Talk Radio, where the CCC CEO Gordon Baum and member Earl Holt have hosted “Right at Night” for 10 years. The station was shut down after the death of the station’s owner.  The Political Cesspool Radio Program  is another radio broadcast that can be heard live every Saturday evening from 6:00pm – 9:00pm CT in Memphis, Tennessee.Specializations, Methods and ToolsEducation  Since the Citizens’ Council’s Movement was rooted in opposition for segregated education, it was no surprise that a good majority of attention was focused on school boards. The Dallas Citizens’ Council was founded in 1957 with a membership of 25,000. Supported by Representative Joe N. Chapman of Sulphur Springs and Texas B.E. Masters, president emeritus of Kilgore Junior College, the Texas Board of Education allowed states funds for desegregated school districts. In the small town of Hoxie, Arkansas, where white students outnumbered African American students by a ratio of 99 to 1, dissent for integration rose until the school board suspended classes for fall harvest weeks in advance. Angry parents picketed and boycotted students from school. In New Orleans, Louisiana,  Leander Perez  , a wealthy land owner, lawyer, and judge, was hired by the Orleans Parish School Board to help prevent desegregation. Perez preached that integration was a communist plot to weaken the country, using the slogan “integration is the Southern expression of communism.”  [4]  In Virginia, massive resistance was evident in extreme measures taken by school districts. Funding was eliminated for public schools attempting to integrate. Special privileges were given to white students, including grants to pay tuition for segregated private schools (excluded by Brown v. Board of Education), tax credits granted to parents who sent children to segregated schools, and additional funds were given to transport white students to segregated private schools.  [7]Intimidation &amp; Violence  The Citizens’ Council initially sought to distinguish from the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), but as their movement began to move towards extreme racial disparities, they soon became labeled as the “country club Klan” or “uptown Klan.” Black voter registration fell from 31.7% to 25.7% between 1956 and 1959 due, in part, to intimidation.  [4]  Direct violence committed by the Citizens' Council was hard to find, but the members of the Council often supported violence executed by the KKK.Major Projects and EventsIn efforts to recreate old town meetings locally, the Citizens’ Council movement urged local groups to gather and discuss ways to “meet any crisis by expressing the will of the people.” [8] The Citizens’ Councils of America encouraged local white Americans to disrupt daily living for African Americans and sympathizers. Below are a few examples that occurred:  Mississippi was a crucial state in the segregationist movement. They claimed a membership of 80,000 in 1956. In 1959, the Citizens’ Council played a key role in electing Ross Barnett, a segregationist, to the Governor’s Office.  At a large public meeting on May 17, 1956, the Citizens' Council of Greater New Orleans launched an attack on the Urban League, an integrated organization devoted to developing job opportunities for blacks. Leander Perez attacked the Urban League as ""a communist organization"" and denounced a list of its board members in public.  [4]On February 10, 1956, twelve thousand whites filled the state coliseum in Montgomery at a Citizens’ Council rally featuring Senator James O. Eastland. It was, at that point in time, one of the largest political gatherings in the history of the state. Many rushed to affiliate themselves with the Council after city officials urged the white community to unite against the bus boycott.  [9]In  Little Rock , disruption caused headline news when the local Capital Citizens’ Council interrupted school board meetings, held letter-writing campaigns to the governor urging him to invoke police powers, and raised havoc within the white community for fear of integration.  Central High School  was in the process of being integrated, and with the help of the National Guard, it was – but not without facing Capital Citizens’ Council’s adamant insistence that “forced integration was impractical.”  [10]Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe Citizens' Council, curiously enough, practiced deliberation at the social and analytical process. By conforming to each other’s racist ideals, the Citizens’ Council united under a common fear of integration. Deliberation is the act of interaction between people as they evaluate choices and reach solutions. When members met for their weekly meetings and discussed recent news, deliberation occurred because they tried to address current issues by gathering resources and agreeing on actions to be taken. But why did such a vast movement which shared political thinking fail ? Political Communication and Deliberation , written by John Gastil, explains the necessary components of deliberation. At the analytical level, the spread of information through mass media successfully created a solid information base for users, and clearly identified a set of values that defined the Citizens’ Council. Yet, the organization ultimately failed to continue its influence on society as the progressive civil rights movement was embraced by the rest of the nation. The Citizens’ Council largely focused on the process of enticing members to join instead of following up on results or brainstorming various ways to execute their opinions. At the social level, the Citizens’ Council adequately fulfilled criteria to ensure mutual comprehension, but failed to give the average citizen adequate opportunity to express their experiences to the big leaders that charismatically led the way. The Councils were controlled by the most-rich and most powerful of society. The decline of this organization can also be accredited to the lack of coherent political deliberation.  Groupthink  The Citizens’ Council is a notable organization of deliberation because it fulfills many groupthink proposals. For one, it brought together individuals in society who identified their lifestyles based on a specific set of beliefs. By first creating an identity that related to the movement, the Citizens’ Council could draw more support by easily appealing to their shared views. The Citizens’ Council effectively mobilized the populace at a local level and was able to amplify local opinions about racial segregation so that they were heard at the national level. Though there was a disconnect between states, all of the councils had the same objective to maintain segregation. [13]  Through maintaining stereotyped views of the opposing groups (“African Americans are bad.”) and withholding negative news or flaws to avoid dispute (i.e. not discussing a new civil rights group, not presenting the latest discovery of integration cities, etc.), members of the Citizens’ Council fell into a monotonous duty to their segregationist ideals. Despite the power and effectiveness of groupthink, many also believe it is an explanation for policy disasters. Flawed decisions are inevitable in a groupthink dynamic since no one dares to question a policy strategy or make suggestions.  Lack of Communication  The Citizens’ Council’s eventual demise can also be attributed to its lack of deliberation at the broader societal level. The movement had difficulty working jointly with other states because each council focused solely on matters that could be handled locally. If Councils had formed monthly or semi-annual meetings for all those involved in Citizens’ Councils of America, or even at the state level between cities, the Citizens’ Council may have survived the more revolutionary and progressive civil rights agenda that destroyed the Citizens’ Council.  Political Language  One of the more manipulative tools the Citizens’ Council fostered was the usage of powerful words to manipulate the public at large. Much like the political scientist Murray Edelman described with the word crisis, repetitive usage of the of words like ‘racism’, ‘dirty’, ‘disease’, and other derogatory adjectives for African Americans confused normal citizens enough to the Councils’ advantage. As Edelman pointed out, “crisis language may be used to encourage the...population to accept [the proposed ideas],” and furthermore often “relaxes resistance to governmental interferences with civil liberties and bolsters support for executive actions, including discouragement of suppression of criticism.""  [13]  Such practice was commonly used by the Citizens’ Councils through their campaigns and propaganda, and extremely effective during the organization's earlier years.PublicationsAs the Citizens’ Council spread into other states, many started to use propaganda to spread the message. On October 15, 1955, the Citizens’ Council in Mississippi released the first issue of  The Citizens’ Council , a pro-segregationist newspaper. By 1960, 50,000 copies of the issue were circulating on average, and television and radio broadcasts were also available for program. Other Citizens’ Council pamphlets often carried messages describing African Americans in extremely racist ways, referring to them as having “an inherent deficiency in mental ability” and “a natural indolence.” [11]  The monthly four-page newspaper contained news from area newspapers, essays from advocates, and articles of similar campaigns in South Africa. Both American and African blacks were de-humanized, portrayed as sexual predators, savages, cannibals, and witch doctors incapable of self-control through cartoons and writing.  [5]  The notorious Black Monday title referring to the day of Brown v. Board of Education, was written by  Thomas Pickens Brady , a Mississippi circuit court judge. The handbook became a staple in the Citizens’ Council’s movement.  In 1956, Robert Patterson published a series of five pamphlets. Patterson used powerful politicians to support his main points: incorporated into his pamphlets was an article by former Supreme Court Justice James F. Brynes of South Carolina, a speech by State Attorney General Eugene Cook of Georgia, and addresses by Senator James O. Eastland and Representative John Bell Williams. Patterson went on to publish sets of single-sheet leaflets which claimed that there were statistics to show that crime, illegitimacy, and venereal disease were more prevalent in blacks than whites.  In January 1956, Montgomery Mayor W.A. Gayle joined the Citizens’ Council, publicly declaring that “every right-right thinking white person in Montgomery, Alabama and the South should do the same.” [12]  By February, membership had doubled. Martin Luther King wrote to President Dwight D. Eisenhower asking him to investigate the Citizens’ Council violence.

 oD Russia (also known as openDemocracy Russia) is an independent news and media group overseen by the deliberative media project, OpenDemocracy.net, for the purposes of expanding deliberation and meaningful discussion over relevant topics of political, economic, and cultural significance within Russia and the post-Soviet region. Overseen by OpenDemocracy.net and its advisory board (yet edited and conducted by an independent panel with relevant expertise to the region), the organization incorporates news, blogs, and opinions from a broad spectrum of sources and intellectual camps onto the oD Russia website, with the aim of fostering a platform for more comprehensive information gathering, value orienting, and deliberation to occur for those who are otherwise only exposed to less deliberative media sources on the relevant topics in the region. More elegantly stated by oD Russia’s founder editors Susan Richards and Zygmunt Dzieciolowski, “openDemocracy Russia offers a thoughtful platform for people concerned about the future of Russia and her desire to establish a new place in the world.” (1) 
 Origins and Development Know the events surrounding this organization’s development? Help us complete this section!Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 oD Russia utilizes a number of main stream news sources, as well as more marginalized opinion sources, when compiling the totality of its presented media. Of particular note is the Moscow ezine polit.ru, for which oD Russia claims is ”at the core of openDemocracy Russia's offering[s]” (1). However, oD Russia also has distributing partnerships with openspace.ru, an internet magazine dedicated to Russian culture, and the Levada Center, a Russian survey research group which conducts regular polls on all aspects of Russian life. Among the list of individual contributors to the website include Floriana Fossato, “a former Moscow correspondent for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty”, Maria Lipman, a “fellow of the Carnegie Moscow Centre”, Andrei Zorin, “a professor of Russian and Fellow of New College, Oxford”, and a much more extensive list of various authors, journalists, and academics who volunteer their work on a list consistent basis. (1) 
 oD Russia’s funding comes from the general openDemocracy budget. According to the OpenDemocracy website, “[half of the grants are] for special projects and sections … including oD Russia” (3). Of the $823,675 which makes up the entirety of openDemocracy’s annual budget, 87% comes from special grants. The 2010 major contributors to the openDemocracy and editorial projects included: The Barrow Cadbury Trust,The Charles E Chadwyck-Healey Charitable Trust, David &amp; Elaine Potter Charitable Foundation, Hivos, The Open Society Institute, The Open Trust, The Tedworth Charitable Trust, Heinrich Boell Foundation, Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust,and John Jackson (3). The maximum amount from these grants directly contributed to oD Russia and its project execution is $716,597. However, oD Russia also has access to the rest of the openDemocracy budget, which is derived from reader donations, books and publications, and advertising and republishing, at 5%, 6%, and 2% respectively (3). Most of the books and publications proceeds come from the openDemocracy Amazon.com store section, for which “all purchases from [the store section] and any search on Amazon starting [there] earn’s OPENDEMOCRACY referral fees” (4). Reader donations are made available at multiple junctions through-out both the openDemocracy main site and the oD Russia site alike. The advertising and republishing appears to result largely out of the republishing and information sharing partnership oD Russia has with polit.ru. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 Among the topics for which oD Russia reports on are “conflict, culture, economy, environment, foreign, history, human rights, internal, law and order, media, politics, and religion” (1). Users are able to either utilize the main page’s “front page,” which displays the most viewed and promoted topics for the day, or search for news and opinion under the specific sections listed above. Also available is the option to search region-specifically, including sections for news and opinion under Abkhazia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan (1). Of particular note is oD Russia’s recognition of Abkhazia as a legitimized nation, an otherwise controversial question of legitimacy, as the region is only recognized by Russia, Nicaraugua, Venezuela, Naura, and the unrecognized national entities of South Ossetia and Transnistria (2). News and opinion are reported under of these sections from a wide spectrum of sources and opinions, often times presenting both sides of an issues arguments, with the ability for users to then comment and continue the discussion using the websites comment forum. oD Russia also has a Facebook fan group and Twitter account, allowing for users to integrate the oD Russia media and deliberation into their social networks. Finally, oD Russia contributes to the printed publishing’s of the openDemocracy network, for which a notable portion of the entirety of the openDemocracy budget is derived. Role and Context in Russian Media ClimateoD Russia plays a unique role in the media climate of Russia. Unlike other western nations, the media in Russia and the post-Soviet region is largely regulated and concentrated, although admittedly not to the extent that occurred during the Soviet period. Like other industries that went through privatization after the fall of the Soviet Union, the media in the region was quickly re-centralized into the hands of elite former party members, parties, and business’ oligarchs due to the process of voucher privatization. Telecommunications was not even fully de-nationalized until late in the 1990’s. During this period, acquisition of media holdings became increasingly important, as “the role of the [emerging parties] was determined by media holdings” (5) This climate resulted in the current media environment, where in Vladimir Putin and the United Russia political party has implemented drastic restrictions on the ability of news outlets to report on all political matters, and the total number of news sources available to the public pales in comparison to similar Western nations (5). 
 Further, the lack of progress Russian news publishers have made in utilizing new media channels, such as the internet, compared to world news sources is of particular note. Due to lack of infrastructure, a majority of Russians are still without high-speed internet access in their homes. As such, the motivation for producing Russo-centric news, and there by taking advantage of the internet’s deliberative advantage, is lacking. Still, even that news which is made available on the internet is more often than not simply the replication of paper sources. One estimate places the figure for the percentage of all internet media being simple replications of paper sources at about 70% (5). 
 oD Russia is unique in the Russian media market in that it focuses on obtaining multiple opinions and input on given topics and that it is almost strictly an online news source, encouraging users to engage the topic discussions actively. The ability to not only publish dissenting opinions on otherwise uniform Russian opinion/official Kremlin position, but as well voice unadulterated support for these positions, makes oD Russia a unique media platform in the Russian media environment. Ultimately, it is these qualities which make this otherwise un-noteworthy online news source impactful and critical to the landscape of its target audience.

 oD Russia’s deliberative quality can be determined using Dr. John Gastil’s five analytical criteria for deliberation: providing a solid information base, prioritizing values, brainstorming a broad range of solutions, weighing pros and cons, and finally making the best decision possible (6). oD Russia excels considerably in the first two steps of establishing information and orienting values. Considering the fact that most Russians gain their news from only one two sources, oD Russia’s emphasis on covering a multiplicity of different types of stories, especially those not being covered anywhere else, contributes greatly to the ability of its users to deliberate further. Similarly, oD Russia excels greatly in helping users orient their values further by compiling opinions and editorials from multiple different ideological camps on the stories being covered. In doing so, users of oD Russia become more acquainted with different thought and analytical patterns, helping them establish an opinion and ideology to utilize in further discussion. The other three deliberative steps are emphasized to a lesser extent by oD Russia. While the website offers a forum for users to comment on the stories and editorials they read, the platform is not set up in a Socratic format, but rather a narrative one. Conceivably, users are able to engage in direct discussion on the website, although admittedly this is not the primary mission or purpose of program. Rather, oD Russia is a tool for which to help otherwise uninformed Russians begin the process of establishing the knowledge and values to engage in deliberation through other mediums. Especially considering the media environment of Russia and the post-Soviet region, oD Russia’s simple contribution and aim of allowing for a more democratic and deliberative civil society to flourish is commendable. While the platform is not directly a deliberative one, its value as a tool to the people of the region is unparalleled.

This organization uses  Deliberative Polling®  to research about democracy and public opinion. The Center for Deliberative Democracy strives to make the general public more aware of public issues in order to make their decisions more deliberative.[1]  Origins and Development  The Center for Deliberative Democracy was established at Stanford University in 2003, where it currently conducts the research and practice of Deliberative Polling®. Previously, the center was under the name Center for Deliberative Polling and was located at the University of Texas at Austin, where Professor James Fishkin, the current director of the Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford, served as director.  James Fishkin developed the concept of Deliberative Polling in 1988 in response to the somewhat surprising effects of mass media on public opinion and knowledge. Early communications scholars, such as Marshall McLuhan, envisioned a world where advances in communicatory technologies such as print and radio would create a “global village,” where the public would be connected and informed on public policies and issues from all sides, including those that are least favorable to the individual, so that one may make a truly informed decision. Instead, mass media has caused the public to seek out media which represents views with which they agree and to be more focused on the entertainment value of media, dwindling campaigns to merely slogans and attack ads. Deliberative Polling was Fishkin’s institutional answer to how to make the public more informed through scientifically sampling citizens, three to four days of  deliberation  on public policies, and proper polling methods to have an end result of a more accurate public opinion. Essentially, deliberative polling is meant to show how the public would feel about public policies and issues if they were better informed and were able to discuss the issues on both the pro and con side of the argument.[2]  Professor James Fishkin has been working on his concept of Deliberative Polling for over twenty years throughout the U.S and various countries in the world, with the Center for Deliberative Democracy as the center for the research and practice of this method. The center has conducted over 50 such polls on every major continent.[3]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Center for Deliberative Democracy is housed in the Department of Communication at Stanford University.[4] The CDD has received funding for an assortment of research and projects through various contributors. These include Stanford University, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation,[5] as well as individual donations,[6] and usage fees on Deliberative Polling, which is a registered trademark of James S. Fishkin.[7] The W. K. Kellogg Foundation awarded the Center $302,123 in 2006 and grant money from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation has been used for the Michigan-based project entitled “Hard Times, Hard Choices,” the Deliberative Polling®: By the People project.[8]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Citizens of the United States are often uninformed about important public issues. Conventional polls represent the public’s initial impressions of headlines and audio clips.  Deliberative Polling®  was developed by the founder of the CDD, James Fishkin, in an attempt to use both television and public opinion research in a new and productive way. The polling process reveals the conclusions the public would reach, if people were more informed and more involved by the public issues.[9]  Major Projects and Events  Since its first Deliberative Poll in 1994, the Center for Deliberative Democracy has led or supported over 50 such polls on every major continent. Participating countries have included the United States, the UK, China, and, most recently, Macedonia.[10] The CDD’s Deliberative Polling events include:Deliberative Polling in the Bududa and Butalejja Districts of UgandaThe UK Deliberative Poll on CrimeTamale Deliberative Poll in Ghana‘What’s Next California?’ Deliberative PollUnited States National Issues Convention Deliberative PollDeliberative Poll on Korean ReunificationDeliberative Polling on Vermont’s Energy FutureDeliberative Polling in Marousi, GreeceThe San Mateo Deliberative PollA Deliberative Poll on Education Policy in Northern IrelandWenling City Deliberative PollDeliberative Pol on Japan’s Energy and Environmental Policy OptionsAnalysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

The organization did so by hosting popular events and conferences throughout Canada. Those working and volunteering at C2D2 valued participatory government through D&amp;D as important to the success of a community or nation. By continually striving for these positive changes, C2D2 was able to recruit hundreds of supporters nationwide.  Origins and Development  Co-founders Miriam Wyman and Sandra Zagon attended the 2002 National Conference on Dialogue and Deliberation ( NCDD ), there realizing the beneficial need for such organizations and conferences in Canada. Three years later, in October 2005, employees at C2D2 helped host the first Canadian Conference on Dialogue and Deliberation. Wyman and Zagon's vision had come true; more than 300 people deliberately participated. The conference was deemed successful because it laid a thriving foundation for which the C2D2 was founded upon. Although the organization was officially founded in 2006, C2D2 had already created a positive impact on the nation.  Throughout its active years, the organization was responsible for a nationwide conference every other year in Canada. In between conferences, employees and volunteers strove to promote strong deliberative processes throughout Canadian communities.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The primary method the organization used was  deliberation . Every two years, the Canadian Community for Dialogue and Deliberation invited citizens and professionals to a deliberative conference.Ottawa 2005: The theme surrounding this conference was, ""From Dream to Reality"". Sandra Zagon and Miriam Wyman initially imagined such a conference in 2002. [2]  Vancouver 2007: The overall theme for Vancouver's conference was, ""Facing Complex Issues Together"". The purpose of the conference was to display all dialogue and deliberative efforts shown through multiple Canadian communities. [3]  Toronto 2009: The theme for Toronto's conference was, ""Leading Change: How Conversations Make Stronger Communities and Healthier Democracies"". This conference emulated topics discussed at the  Australia's Citizens Parliament  (February 2009). [4]Major Projects and EventsD&amp;D Evaluation ProjectThroughout the year 2010, C2D2 held multiple conference calls. This was an opportunity for citizens to evaluate the organization's efforts on strengthening dialogue and deliberation. In August and November, national conference calls were held, as well as opportunities for feedback during the Toronto conference. The organization made pdf files of the notes during each call available on their website. These calls presented valuable learning opportunities for C2D2 because of the concentrated interaction between citizens and professionals.EventsIn 2010, C2D2 helped coordinate multiple events throughout Canada, including:January 21, 2010,  Canadian and US Experiences in Public Involvement -  Learning from our Neighbors : Citizens from Canada and the northern United States shared experiences and methods on how to engage the public in environmental issues.

We define dialogue as “listening deeply enough to be changed by what you learn.” [1]Origins and DevelopmentFounded in 2002 by American diplomat Dr. Hal Saunders, The Sustained Dialogue Institute (SDI) began as a collaboration with Princeton University for students to dispute heavy topics.Dr. Saunders arose as a member of a small mediation group for Arab-Israeli agreements “including the Kissinger shuttle agreements, the Camp David accords and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty.”In his observations during these meditations, Dr. Saunders learned that participants’ relationships developed over time with distinct patterns. Considering his observations, the Institute established two foundations forthe process of sustained dialogue  : “(1) focuses on transforming relationships that cause problems, create conflict, and block change; and (2) emphasizes the importance of effective change over time” [2]The process of Sustained Dialogue began developing with the collaboration with students in 2002, but the Institute was first developed as a project in 2003, founded by the Sustained Dialogue Campus Network made up of Dr. Saunders graduate students.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe Sustained Dialogue Institute receives funding through donations from individuals and institutions that act as sponsors, such as: The Kettering Foundation, The W.K. Kellogg Foundation. The Carnegie Corporation of New York, The Foundation for Global Community, The Fetzer Institute. Princeton Class of 1952, MRM Worldwide, USA Network, Comcast Xfinity, The Boeing Corporation, The Whitman Institute, The Hershey Company, Bloomberg, The Lisle Foundation, The McFarlane Family Foundation, and the American Eagle Outfitters Foundation.The SDI acts as a public charity and nonprofit organization [3]Through a subscription service, SDI provides quarterly newsletters that provide updates on workshops and summits as well as access to archives.The Sustained Dialogue Institute also offers volunteer and career opportunities as well as encourages students to start a campus chapter in which they can establish a partnership with the Institute workshops or membership engagements.Specializations, Methods and ToolsSustained Dialogue is identified as finding causal relationships that hinder the process of deliberation to occur and to provide a space to produce the capacities necessary, to practice these capacities, and to create the relationships vital to political and economic democracy.The SDI also coordinates the use of Sustained Dialogue through the Sustained Dialogue Campus Network (SDCN), an organizational/networking tool developed to assist colleges with the implementation and support of SD Groups.Sustained Dialoguefocuses and analyzes the nature of individual and community relationships. This is understood through a 5 stage process: “The “Who”: Deciding to Engage, The “What”: Mapping and Naming, The “Why”: Probing Problems and Relationships, The “How”: Scenario building,and The “Now”: Individual and Collective Action” [4]How to Initiate Training on CampusPartnerships with the Institute can be done through holding a worship or membership engagementThe Sustained Dialogue Institute website provides a contact button to schedule a call and determine an offer amongst long time partnerships, workshops, virtual enrollment as well as pricingThe Sustained Dialogue Campus Network has 64 campus connections internationally and provides case studies of how programs have been institutes through program campus integrations.University of Tampa:https://sustaineddialogue.org/studies/case-study-1/Northwestern University:https://sustaineddialogue.org/studies/case-study-2/Case Western Reserve University:https://sustaineddialogue.org/studies/case-study-3/Major Projects and EventsAs The Sustained Dialogue Institute began as a collaboration between professors and university students, it continues its efforts through Sustained Dialogue programs on University campuses as well as reaching out to smaller communities, workplaces, as well as internationally.University campuses and SD academy“  Sustained Dialogue Academy teaches leadership skills to bridge divides.” [5]The Sustained Dialogue Academy provides full access to its resources and training across college campuses. It does not limit student access to just university grounds but allows students in cohorts who do not have access to a college's campus. The curriculum is based in Capitol Hill but expands its services nationally and internationally offering in-person and online training.The SD academy is actively providing spaces for individuals searching to improve their workplace and personal skills so that enrollment in academic institutions will no longer be a requirement.As campus life evolves with the academy, the Institute provides a full outline of the who, what and where of the program. Organization, audience, credit, initiatives, and intensives are broken down by their structures, benefits and challenges on different campuses including Beloit College, Case Western Reserve University, Auburn University, University of Alabama etc.,Organization:Student and/or faculty organized/moderated, strong student leadership/ownership/paid employees/spread out tasks, requisitions for commitment/ownership/paid positionsAudience:Faculty/Staff/Students dialogues and departments, Increased engagements/inclusivity/community, hierarchy conflicts requisitions of investments and connectionsCredit:SD as a course or infused with graduate requirements, improvements in participation/distribution/retention, requirements for faculty members to oversee SD courses or establish moderationInitiatives:Presidential/residential initiatives, insurance of management skills/training/support, ownership/scheduling conflictsIntensives  : 4 day retreats/semester kick-offs, building strong relations/increasing participation/retention of SD stages, requires commitment/logistic/funding“What SD Can Look Like on Campus” -https://secureservercdn.net/45.40.145.201/a00.d45.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/What-SD-Can-Look-Like-on-Campus_PDF.pdfCommunitiesThe Institute has developed communal support initiatives to establish foundations in building relationships with diverse families and different socio-economic circumstances. The SDI provides examples from its bases in Washington, DC, Columbus, Indiana, and Puerto Rico.Washington DC:Kindred was founded in 2016 assisting families and POC’s with obtaining equity in education, environment, and resources for children. Their partnership with the Sustained Dialogue began in 2017 encouraging parents to learn the 5 stages of SD, “culminating in an action plan to improve their school. Kindred’s dialogue groups are forming a network of diverse parents fighting for equity.” [6]Columbus, Indiana:“The Columbus Indiana Community Area Sustained Dialogue, now completing two full years of monthly sessions, focuses its work on identifying and addressing obstacles to and creating opportunities for economically challenged citizens to achieve self-sufficiency – economically, socially and emotionally.” [7]Puerto Rico:“For almost a year in 2014 a diverse group of stakeholders in the controversial education reform movement in Puerto Rico requested SDI Associate Ramon Daubon’s help in organizing and moderating a slowly broadening dialogue separate from the contentious official policy process.” [8]InternationalAs Dr. Saunder’s work originated in international mediation efforts, a global resolution has remained a priority for SD groups to organize meetings and active programs for conversations between countries.“SDI oversees the longest-running citizen’s dialogue between the United States and Russia, and has administered dialogue programs in the Middle East, countries in the former Soviet Union, and Africa. We also have campus programs in Africa and Mexico.” [9]Case studies between Sustained Dialogue and international conferences can be examined from 1960 to 2015 including:The Dartmouth Conference (1960 - 2015):a bilateral sustained dialogue between present Russia and the United states discussing preemptive and preventive measures for resolutions of nuclear war and strengthening relationships between the two great powersTajikistan (1993 - 2005):a conference made up of Russian and Americans to resolve the civil war and negotiate peace to establish democratic strategies resolved from the Dartmouth Conference.Armenia and Azerbaijan (1993 - 2007):sustained dialogue resolved over 6 years of conflict and peace negotiations to determine a ceasefire, resulting in developments in participatory peace processes to implement dialogue amongst meeting participants.Southern Africa (2003 - 2005):a relationship developed with the Sustained Dialogue Campus Network and the Institute for Democracy in Africa, to address socio-economic inequalities and the elimination of violence. Sustained Dialogue established the relationship between marketplace citizens and local governments to create accessible communication to address those conflicts.Arab-American European Dialogue (2004 - 2007):meetings made up of citizens globally addressed the armed conflict in the Arab world in response to the events of September 11, 2001. Topics addressed focus on the awareness of post-conflict realities in middle eastern countries and Muslims in Western countries.Iraq (2007-2009):Sustained Dialogue developed legislation and implementation to support reconciliation in Iraq to counteract political movements in which they succeeded in “1) recognition by nearly all parties of the urgency of ending the conflict, 2) recognition of this dialogue as providing such a possibility, and 3) participant readiness to work through their deeply-rooted ethnic, religious, and political differences. This dialogue continues today under Italian leadership.” [10]Annual EventsExternal form campus events coordinated by faculty and students partnered with the Institute, Sustained Dialogue programs have events and workshops available to the public surrounding involvement activities and education summits to learn more about the Institutes in-person and virtual programs.National Dialogue Awards:a recognition ceremony to “honor the awardees and celebrate the role of dialogue in transforming national and global conflicts” [11]SD Academy Workshop: Bridging Divides Through SD:a workshop for managers and staff members to “learn about how Sustained Dialogue, a proven conflict management strategy, can be used in your workplace and community.

Along with the five stages of Sustained Dialogue, relationships, in this case, are analyzed through five elements:Identity  : An individual’s self-identification of their own experiencesInterests:An individuals core values for want and need considering all things tangible and non-tangiblePower:the capability to have control and effect in your own life as well as othersPerceptions:assumptions developed by society that manipulate our thinking whether right or wrong contributing to the stereotypical analysisPatterns of Interaction:the interactivity between individuals and groups developed by asserted projections resulting in positive, negative, or neutral responsesPublicationsBooks by Harold H.

The purpose of CIVICUS is to help nations to improve citizen participation in community service and around shared humanitarian causes. This action is meant to connect with governments and encourage them to cultivate what they see as an under-cultivated resource, civilian engagement.  More specifically, the goal is to aid civil society-oriented, non-profit NGOs in the protection, restoration, or expansion of “civic space”, civilian freedom, and motivation to gather around and solve social problems. In a 2005 interview, CIVICUS's Secretary General, Kumi Naidoo, stated that at the time, the focus of the group was rectifying the “attack on civil liberties that is happening in the context of the war on terror.” [2] All of these goals are founded on the opinion that a democracy can only exist if it allows, and more importantly harnesses, the energy and creativity of its citizenry.  The stated values the CIVICUS views as integral to its purpose as they appear on the CIVICUS website:[3]Justice and Equality - CIVICUS believes in the equality and dignity of every person, and that all people should be free to exercise their rights as citizens as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Reciprocity - CIVICUS exists to ensure that people treat one another with the respect with which they themselves wish to be treated. Civil society cannot thrive without mutual respect.  Knowledge - CIVICUS recognises that to increase its global awareness of civil society and before it can assist or take action, it needs to form alliances with other concerned bodies to increase its influence and knowledge.  Vision - CIVICUS is realistic about conflict in today's world, but remains optimistic that most people, organisations, governments and businesses will work together for the benefit of all.  Principled Courage - CIVICUS will always promote civil justice and pledges to act in a manner that honours the principles of democratic civil society.Origins and Development  The development of CIVICUS began in 1991 with the meeting of a group of twenty civil society leaders and the agreement to form an experimental international alliance of individuals and NGOs with the aim of enhancing civil society around the globe. CIVICUS was officially formed in Barcelona in 1993 and the original board consisted of members from 18 different countries. Since then it has expanded and begun many new projects. The first  CIVICUS World Assembly  was held in 1995, and it has been held many times since. It is largely out of these conferences that the initiatives were begun: The Civil Society Index in 2000, The Affinity Group of National Associations in March 2004, The Civil Society Watch in 2005, and the Legitimacy, Transparency, and Accountability initiative began in 2010.[4]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  When CIVICUS was founded, it was temporarily based in Washington D.C., but it relocated and is permanently headquartered in Johannesburg, South Africa. Kumi Naidoo was the Secretary General of CIVICUS between mid-1998 and 2008, presiding over the majority of the organization's growth. He was replaced soon after leaving by Ingrid Srinath, and as of 2021, the Secretary General is Lysa John Berna.[5]  There are over 9,000 participants in around 175 different countries.[6] The purpose of this membership is to create an influential force by coordinating with partner NGOs and NGO leaders. These members' influence spans from the local to international levels. The nature of the various NGOs is diverse in terms of their contribution to civil society, including: “civil society networks and organizations; trade unions; faith-based networks; professional associations; NGO capacity development organizations; philanthropic foundations and other funding bodies; businesses; and social responsibility programs.”[7]Based on past CIVICUS annual reports (2008 was the most recent available year, as of writing), it receives the vast majority of its funding from public and private grants. In this report, the following organizations were credited with funding support:[8]  ActionAid International, African Monitor, Aga Khan Foundation Canada, Amnesty International, Australian Volunteers International (AVI), Canadian International Development Agency, Carnegie UK Trust, Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, Christian Aid, Commonwealth Foundation, Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, CordAid, Debt, AID, Trade Africa (DATA),  Ford Foundation , Ibis, Institute of International Education, Inter-American Foundation, International Development Research Centre/Centre de Recherches pour le Développement International (IDRC/CRDI), Inter-America Foundation, Irish Aid, International Human Rights Exchange (IHRE), University of Witwatersrand, International Senior Lawyers Project (ISLP), New Zealand Aid, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), One Campaign, Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), Overseas Development Institute, Oxfam America, Oxfam GB, Oxfam Novib, Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Sasakawa Peace Foundation, Schooner Foundation, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Tides Foundation, Trocaire, United Nations Democracy Fund,  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) , United Nations Millennium Campaign, United Nations Volunteers (UNV), Wallace Global Fund, Wolfensohn Family Foundation, World Vision International.  CIVICUS also charges a small membership fee, and accepts donations from individuals.  When CIVICUS was founded, it received funding from the Ford Foundation, the Kellogg Foundation, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, and the Carnegie Corporation. To countries that were expected to struggle with the costs of participation, The Hitachi Foundation gave $250,000.[9]Specializations, Methods and Tools  CIVICUS sees itself as an international platform for connecting similarly-concerned citizens to each other, as well as to information resources, and possibly being a conduit for the creation of new NGOs.In pursuit of the realization of their values (see Mission and Purpose above), CIVICUS works to expand and protect free association and collective action rights, improving civil society management, particularly in goal setting, and encouraging productive relationships between civil society organizations and other institutions.Outside of the main four campaigns under the CIVICUS umbrella, the Affinity Group of National Organizations (AGNA) and the  CIVICUS World Assembly (CWA)  are both important undertakings for the organization.  The CIVICUS World Assembly is a conference that has been held periodically since 1995. It has taken place all over the world: six different countries for nine conferences. This conference is open to participation from the general public, business, and civil society and government leaders. A few past speakers at the CWA: Former US President Jimmy Carter, Desmond Tutu, and Former Ireland President Mary Robinson. The conference picks a new theme each time; the last two theme statements were “People, Participation and Power” and “Accountability: Delivering Results.”[10]  The Affinity Group of National Associations was started in 2004 for the purpose of gathering networks of NGOs that operate on a national or regional level. The focus of AGNA is creating a resource for information on civil society as well as encouraging international coordinated civic engagement in trans-boundary causes. It works to advocate for these associations which “actively promote the values and principles that underpin CIVICUS.”[11]Major Projects and EventsThe Civil Society Index (CSI)  is a method for quantitatively measuring the quality of a nation's civic openness and participation. The idea is that it will be used to develop plans for strengthening civil society in each nation that uses it. The CSI is managed by national level NGOs to expand the base of knowledge useful for strengthening civil society. Government, supporters, and scholars all are involved with a nation's CSI process.  To achieve positive change, the CSI conductors use “participatory and other research methods to create an assessment of the state of civil society.” Once finished, the findings are used to create goals and a plan for the improved quality and sustainability of civil society in the medium to long term. Part of this improvement consists of increasing real world impact on community problems and social progress. [12]The Participatory Governance Programme (PGP)  focuses on governments and NGOs in the southern hemisphere. It works to improve the accountability and citizen involvement in governmental action at all levels. The way the PGP seeks to do this is by increasing the knowledge base regarding the effective execution of participatory government; by educating facilitators on how best to cultivate civic involvement; by strengthening connections between volunteers/NGOs and government leaders/institutions; and by providing support to new, original projects/methods supported by both government and civil society, and aimed at promoting participatory governance.  The purpose of the  Legitimacy, Transparency, and Accountability Programme (LTA)  is to develop institutional mechanisms to make civil society organizations more transparent and accountable. This is done with the belief that NGOs cannot be effective or sustainable without accountability measures. This initiative works to recognize and analyze legitimacy threats, to institute appropriate methods of ensuring accountability, and to continue to learn and develop effective mechanisms based on prior instances of LTA issues.Civil Society Watch (CSW)  is a program relating to the timely identification and response to what is evaluated to be a threat to civil society and democratic liberties, mostly from the perspective that states are reacting to terrorism and other threats by instituting policies that are unacceptably intrusive. The primary way of doing this is the Early Warning System that the program has developed. This system works by monitoring media, governmental publication/statements, IGO reports, NGO reports, and in some cases civilian observation, and then producing an assessment every two weeks on possible jeopardy to civil society. The actions following these reports may include press statements, writing letters to decision making bodies, etc.Analysis and Lessons Learned  CIVICUS is not exactly a  deliberation -dedicated body, but clearly its values and goals are oriented toward the sharing of knowledge, the freedom of ideas and association, and drawing the citizenry into participation in issues at the local to global level. These aims will both directly and indirectly provide support for good deliberation.  By promoting participation in NGO work and civic involvement, CIVICUS encourages the  education  of citizens in social and political issues. This also allows for the consideration of more and presumably more diverse viewpoints. Through its creation of various forums for international information exchange, CIVICUS broadens the knowledge base of leaders in diverse fields. These platforms allow more people to express their viewpoints. The LTA initiative augments these benefits by working to shed light on the origins of information and possible viewpoint influences, improving the knowledge base's quality.  Also, the CWA is a deliberative body. The conference attracts participants from all over the world. The CWA evaluates itself on criteria such as southern hemisphere and regional participation, and participant learning. The conference is broken into much smaller  workshops , with greater individual participation the goal.Publications  CIVICUS' publications are available on their  website .

Programs from the station all have underlying purposes and targeted audiences, which use their uncommon formats to educate, stimulate conversation, and develop the minds of all listeners.  Bush Radio wrote its mission statement when it first began over a decade ago, yet it still is applied to each program today. It reads as follows:  “To ensure that communities who have been denied access to resources take part in producing ethical, creative and responsible radio that encourages them to communicate with each other, to take part in decisions that affect their lives, and to celebrate their own cultures. Through such radio, communities will affirm their own dignity and identity, and promote social responsibility and critical thinking”.[1]Origins and DevelopmentIn 1989, during the height of the apartheid era in South Africa, a community service project called Cassette Education Trust (CASET) began, which involved dispersing cassette tapes that brought about information to help build a dependable democracy. These tapes were the equivalence of a political talk radio program, but were not punishable by the government due to the non-broadcasted nature of the discussions. Unfortunately with CASET, community input was impossible; yet the idea for Bush Radio came from the combination of the CASET contents and nature of speech, with the ability for listeners to contribute their viewpoints on the issues.  Bush Radio formed in 1992, but did not broadcast until April 25th, 1993. Unfortunately, the station had not been granted a broadcasting license from the government, and within hours of that broadcast, the government arrested and charged the company’s major leaders and seized vital broadcasting equipment.  Protests  from the Bush Radio students and volunteers pressured the government to drop the charges against the Chairperson and Coordinator of the station and return all of the equipment. In 1994, South Africa had their first democratic elections, which brought a more integrated society upon South Africa. This also brought about the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), which was meant to supervise the radio industry in South Africa at the time; it was the IBA which first granted Bush Radio its broadcasting license, first temporarily but later reinstated permanently in 2002. Since 2002, Bush Radio has been broadcasting 24/7 with more than just musical content.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and ToolsListener ParticipationThe programs offered by Bush Radio vary in format and structure. Some programs discuss African politics and have callers contribute their opinions to the debate. For example, on Saturday afternoons, the topic changes to underage drinking and drugs as teenagers talk on air, while also asking for callers to add to the  deliberation  on these issues. On Friday evenings, Michael Parenti – a political author and lecturer – is a featured speaker in the commentary. These discussions are presented amidst the vast musical selection in a unique style that holds interests, yet provides stimulating and inviting conversations about various separate topics.Bush Radio and the CommunityBush Radio participates actively in the community, making it much more than just a radio station. It not only broadcasts, but it also engages in uplifting community projects, provides scholarships and training programs for those interested in a radio career path, as well as investing in human potential development at all ages.Bush radio is able to affiliate itself as a community radio due to its fulfillment of all three aspects of that specific category of broadcasting media, including access, participation and self-management. Bush Radio presents itself to the community in a friendly and welcoming environment through all of its activities. It encourages community involvement through callers and input on current issues and other topics. It is also uses a small staff – including trainees through the BTI partnership – and many volunteers to keep the station up and running.Major Projects and EventsSome of the most prominent Bush Radio regional projects include the Youth Against Aids (YAA) and the collaboration with the South African Red Cross Society, with each project having its own relevant on-air segment. Furthermore, Bush Radio awards scholarships to candidates that they see with the most potential to succeed, mainly in the field of journalism/broadcasting. They also partner with Broadcasting Training Institute (BTI) to provide superior training to its member, including radio broadcasting, video journalism, drama production, documentary and feature production, and radio management, in order to create the most skilled staff and best radio program as possible. Finally, to see the community grow to its highest potential, it has established a daycare for kids of the ages 3 months – 2 years, the Children’s Radio Education Workshop (CREW) program targets the development of the youth (ages 6-18) to mold them into media consumers of the future, and the Alternative Kurriculum Mentoring Youth (Alkemy) educates listeners between the ages 18-24 on political issues while beginning the basis for philosophical thought. Bush Radio works hard to push for a more knowledgeable pool of community members in the future for South Africa.In The Pink ProgramIn The Pink was a revolutionary concept for African radio; this program was the first widespread gay and lesbian media outlet on the entire continent. The purpose of such a program was to provide “a platform to voice the struggle from the perspective of gay identity” according to it’s main producer, Adrian Alberts. The program allowed for poets, special musical guests and community listeners coping with homosexual struggles to call in and share their stories and inputs on current issues relevant to the overall program’s theme. In The Pink provides an especially deliberative process with a talk show format, striving for the inclusion of a diverse community and general discussions of current gay and lesbian topics and opinions, while maintaining respect for all viewpoints.Youth Against Aids and HIV-Hop ProgramsIn 2000, Bush Radio began the campaign against childhood AIDS, entitled Youth Against Aids (YAA). The purpose of this campaign and radio program was to educate high school students on the issue of HIV/AIDS at that time. The Bush Radio staff also set out to local schools once a month during this campaign to invite students to talk openly about sex-related topics in addition to weekly live shows during lunches. From YAA began a five-week on-air program, called HIV-Hop. This program is what started a mass involvement of teenagers in the broadcasted discussions of the AIDS epidemic. Teens from all over Cape Town, and other local areas, called in to add to the conversations during these programs. On one specific Friday night, a young man called in and began rapping about the AIDS crisis. The following quote is a small excerpt from that broadcast:  “It’s cold and lonely, coz it’s eating you slowlyBrothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, kings and queensIt’s all upon usThe clock is ticking and the score ain’t in our favorPeople are dying it feels like dying is saferThe headlines read, AIDS hit the streetYou gotta open your ears, eyes and know the beatUnprotected sex, sharing needles”  This began the mass of young adults calling Bush Radio to share their rhymes with the community. It also spawned passionate, on-air debates amongst teens about topics related to HIV/AIDS, such as condoms in schools and abstinence until marriage. After January 2002, the YAA and HIV-Hop programs ended, but in its place began a new program called Positive Living, which a more traditional and permanent broadcast of medical advice from experts about HIV/AIDS and other issues of the present.Bush Radio TodayCurrently, Bush Radio features six different discussion-based programs, including The Breakfast Show, The Morning Cruise, Sakhisizwe – bou die nasie (building the nation), Backchat with Bassie, Everyday People, and CREW. There are also 11 specialty music programs presented throughout different times in the week. Bush Radio also outreaches to a larger audience by offering the option of listening live from their website, as well as following their various social media pages. Bush Radio has won several awards for their unique integration of deliberation amongst community members through the radio, including the Prince Claus Award for Urban Heroes in 2000 and the second place award in the New York International Radio Festival in 2001 for HIV-Hop. They have also been honored with several awards from the Department of Communication in 2005, such as Best Provincial Achiever.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

The effect generated by each of these ideas is the change in relationships, the reappropriation of spaces, making collective capacities visible, valuing everyday space by generating material transformations, of meaning and densification of civil society from the local.Problems and PurposeThe Cerro Cordillera, at the height of the Camino Cintura, was one of the first popular settlements in Valparaíso, this town stands out for its deep port tradition, of union and worker organization.In recent decades, the hill has been impoverished by the aging of its inhabitants, the unemployment of youth and the prevalence of drug use (SUBDERE, CIC &amp; GTZ., 2008).The problems identified by the locality in its beginnings were mainly related to the deterioration and non-existence of public spaces, the presence of garbage dumps in streams, with a high sanitary deficit and infections in the community. Within the social aspects, there was low participation and mistrust in the existing leaders.The conditions of employment and habitability were deficient, as well as the lack of community equipment and infrastructure (Fundación Hábitat Colombia, 2005).In this scenario, in 1998, a group of founding partners of the Community Action Workshop (TAC), toured different hills of Valparaíso, looking for a space with neighborhood life where to generate a local development project, with the aim of rebuilding links community and improve the living conditions of its inhabitants. In this sense, the Cordillera hill fulfilled these potentials, in terms of its historical trajectory, and the presence of various social organizations and local institutions that could participate in the initiative, and its inhabitants had a level of basic needs covered. The latter made it possible to generate a project focused on community and non-welfare development.Since its inception its purpose was to promote community development, through participation in concrete initiatives of local incidence, its intervention model starts from the base of education, formal or informal training on health, environment, market, culture. This comprehensive development includes the material improvement of the habitat and the neighborhood environment. His work is aimed at children, youth, women, adults, the elderly, neighbors, organizations, functional and / or territorial institutions (TAC Magazine, 2009).HistoryThe beginnings of the TAC go back to 1989, a period in which it constituted a work program of the NGO CECAP (Centro de Capacitación y Asesoría Poblacional), which was aimed at promoting the development of community life in poor localities of the city. Valparaíso (TAC Magazine, 2009).In the first stage, his work on the Cordillera hill was oriented to the development of a self-diagnosis, where leaders, residents and grassroots organizations participated to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the neighborhood. Among the priorities to work are recognized: to generate conditions that facilitate the encounter and participation in the local development process, demonstrate in concrete actions in the territory possibilities of transformation, recognize and value the local space (Library CF + S, 2006).In 1990 the organization was located in a gorge in the Cordillera that had been turned into a garbage dump for more than 40 years. Cleaning days were started where the community was invited to participate. Once recovered, the first square was consolidated and the first murals inspired by local history were made.This period was essential to generate mutual trust between the organization, neighborhood leaders, local organizations and schools in the sector (TAC Magazine, 2009).In the 1990s, the majority of non-governmental organizations in the country began to receive a decrease in financial resources, despite this, the TAC continues to move forward and decides to become an autonomous institution of CECAP, from which the work begins to be sustained. in Associativity and local participation, highlighting the work and permanence of the founding team of the initiative. Since this year the organization begins to sustain itself through voluntary action and specific projects, this change in operation lays the foundations that have given it sustainability over time (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).In this period the strategy is to coordinate with the actors around the territory, recovering the physical spaces through planning meetings and mutual knowledge. Strengthening the sense of community takes a central role from the articulation of local organizations, educational establishments and the health clinic (CF + S Library, 2006).Between 1996 and 1998, they are considered as the years of consolidation of the project and projection of the TAC, a process of systematization of the experience begins and work begins on the dissemination of the work carried out on a local and communal scale through posters, bulletins, links with the press and stable workshops with the educational establishments of the commune.At the end of this stage, the amphitheater in the recovered ravine is finished, where a collective and local space for culture capable of housing 600 people is consolidated, more than 1000 people participate in its construction.The fourth stage, from 1999 to 2001, is recognized as the period where there is already a legitimation of the intervention model. The organization is concerned with the construction of means of dissemination and educational material, internships and meetings are held with different actors in the territory. At the end of this cycle, the 31st summer school takes place, where the majority of young people from the Andes, former children become monitors, this milestone is important to mention, since these young people are the ones who begin to organize and generate significant changes in the territory later (TAC Magazine, 2009).This last period, from 2002 to 2009, has been focused on reviewing what has been done and on the work of replicating the intervention model in academic, public and other local realities.The main actors have been children, young people, volunteers, the cordillera network, universities and public organizations.The management of resources in this last period has been through projects, voluntary action, local participation, associativism, development of cooperation agreements with national and foreign universities and public organizations (TAC Magazine, 2009).Organizational Structure and FundingThe sustainability of this experience is given by its intervention model that is based on an associative structure through the Cordillera network made up of different organizations that represent different areas of the territory.Once the TAC is established in Cordillera, it promotes the articulation and coordination of these existing organizations. This platform has been strategic for local empowerment, linkage of actors and feedback with the environment, guiding the work towards the vision of a jointly designed and concretized community development.The organizational figure of the Community Action Workshop is structured in three levels; the directory in charge of delivering general strategic guidelines, both for educational work and for management; the central team, responsible for designing educational work with schools and management tasks; and the field work team, in charge of planning the specific activities to be carried out in each work session with the schools.We can understand the structure of the network from different spheres of participation. In its center, we identify the TAC as a linking agent of the network, articulating in a first sphere of local participation, made up of more active organizations within planning and decision-making in the territory, among them we identify the Union&#39;s working population, the Red Cross, local volunteers, clinic, parish and 12 public schools. Also incorporating peripheral organizations such as sports clubs, police, mothers&#39; centers and the different neighborhood associations (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).In a second sphere of participation, we identify the extra-local actors made up of collaborating companies, volunteers, public services and associated universities (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).As leading actors, children, young people and volunteers are recognized, who are constant participants, from the comprehensive program that is carried out throughout the year with the associated schools and the workshops given in the summer and winter schools.Regarding the selection of participants, we identified 4 categories: self-selection, rather natural selection in the case of volunteers, who get involved and acquire responsibilities according to their level of commitment and time availability. In the case of targeted recruitment, we identify the courses of the schools selected to participate during the year in the comprehensive program taught by the TAC, thirdly are the stakeholders, made up of the leaders of social organizations, who actively participate within the net. Finally, within the second sphere of participation are the professional interest groups made up of NGOs, public and private organizations that participate in technical tables, fairs, internships and seminars, which always participate voluntarily, without being paid.Specializations and ActivitiesIts lines of action are the following (SUBDERE, CIC &amp; GTZ., 2008):1) Articulation of the Local and Communal network through the generation of associative relationships between different organizations, expanding the vision of the territory by sharing and exchanging learning.2) Prevention actions in children and young people through workshops that promote the good use of free time in concrete actions for the improvement and recovery of the physical and social environment.3) Education and environmental improvement, children and young people are constituted as agents in the process of recovery and transformation of spaces from a methodology of education in action.4) Cultural action, articulating the spaces of expression and diffusion of culture in the hills through the creation of murals.5) Rescue of local identity, we work from workshops, recovery and restoration of heritage landmarks aimed at rescuing and valuing tangible and intangible heritage, strengthening and recognizing the construction of the history that constitutes them.6) Recovery and improvement of public spaces, this line of action has been consolidated over time through the conquest of new spaces for public use (garbage dumps, empty sites, parking lots).7) Community library, the use of free time is promoted in spaces oriented to culture and technology.8) Strengthening of voluntary action, through citizen exercise based on local development, self-management and civic responsibility. Currently a network of volunteers from the same locality, from universities and foreigners is formed.9) Extension, the exchange of experiences and learning with other initiatives is promoted through fairs, internships, seminars, forums and educational visits at the local, communal, regional, national and international levels.The purpose and lines of action of the TAC are specified in an educational space complementary to the formal one, focused mainly on children and young people through three instances:1) Comprehensive Program: stable workshops that are constituted in weekly work sessions with courses from the various participating establishments, aimed at children and young people between 3 and 25 years old, corresponding to basic, special and integrated schools and kindergartens.In these sessions various topics are addressed, which are linked to the problems and concerns that have arisen in the field of formal education.The activities take place during class hours, forming part of the academic curriculum of the establishments. Each course attends the TAC once a week and the working day lasts an hour and a half.2) Seasonal schools: They correspond to various workshops that take place simultaneously for periods of 4 to 12 consecutive days, normally held during winter and summer holidays, and are aimed at children and young people between 5 and 25 years old, from schools associated with the network, the local and extra-local community.The daily work day runs from 9 in the morning to 4:30 in the afternoon, including a space for breakfast, lunch and a snack.3) Thematic workshops: this strategy is aimed at developing workshops associated with specific themes, the implementation of which is occasional. The duration of the workshops is defined based on a relevant number of sessions agreed upon by the participating actors, including children, young people from the schools associated with the network, adults in general, women, the elderly, leaders of social organizations. and territorial (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).Major Projects and EventsTo put in context the mechanisms used in decision-making promoted by the vision of the TAC, it is important to expose the local action methodology that the organization has developed in these 21 years and that has been promoted from three perspectives of work in the territory.In the first place, the Associativity, through the exchange of experiences, horizontality, flexibility and permanence in time of the Cordillera network. The associative links between the different organizations have made it possible to mobilize local resources (mainly physical and human).Second, the local participation of the different organizations and volunteers jointly build the strategies, plans, projects and actions. This has allowed over time a strong appropriation of the spaces gained, strengthening community ties and social relations with actors outside the community (Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).In this context we identify the type of participation at the level of co-management associations or rather co-construction, since this initiative has strengthened the bonds and the social capital of the locality, constituting new leaders and new forms of organization.The interaction between the participants and decision-making is deliberative and of sum of preferences, that is, the mode of communication is through the exchange of visions, information and learning, it seeks to reach an agreement based on arguments and consensus through collective participation .The TAC management style promotes democratic, transformational and participatory leadership, generating a sense of belonging and human bonds.The spaces for participation have been consolidated over time, through assemblies, work tables, workshops, where the main actors are citizens in general, public authorities, community leaders, volunteers, children and young people.In general terms, it is possible to identify a decision-making process that includes different phases, which has been called “reflection in action”. This methodology is structured in this sequence: convocation of various local actors to participate in participatory diagnoses, identifying problems, opportunities and work challenges, with this material the proposals are jointly prepared. The second phase is constituted by the management of local resources to implement the proposed actions, which in most cases is based on self-management, then the actions are implemented and finally, the process and sense of the experience is evaluated ( Cerda &amp; Rojas, 2004).Public interaction occurs in spaces for dialogue even beyond the local, through seminars, internships, fairs, where the TAC is represented through its local and extra-local volunteers according to the themes contemplated by said meeting spaces. Different actors from civil society, organizations and public authorities participate in these.Another form of public interaction has turned out to be public recognition of the experience, through the awards it has obtained both locally, nationally and internationally. Among the most outstanding is the first regional place in environment by the National Commission of the Environment of Chile; recognition of Good Urban Practices 2002 by the Ministry of Housing and Urbanism Chile, award for Innovation in the environmental area 2002 by the Ford International Foundation, among others.Outcomes and EffectsThe results and effects of the work carried out by the TAC in the territory will be presented from 3 dimensions, first from a quantitative point of view, second from a qualitative point of view, and finally, a concrete case will be presented that shows the replicability of the experience.Quantitative results:There are currently more than 40 organizations associated with the Cordillera network. Among them: 12 public and subsidized schools: common, integrated and special; and 10 foreign universities and institutions. (TAC WEB site). These actors are key in mobilizing resources.Eight meeting and recreation spaces, squares and games have been recovered, transformed and created in Cerro Cordillera (Biblioteca CF + S, 2006).An amphitheater has been built in the heart of one of the Cordillera streams in an old garbage dump, with a capacity for 630 people. (Fundación Habitat Colombia, 2005)Active participation of 200 volunteers and 1,300 children per year approximately.7 Valparaíso universities incorporate the work of the TAC (Fundación Habitat Colombia, 2005) into their curricula through hours of professional practice specifically in pedagogy and special education. 140 young university students have joined the participation in this association.50 murals have been made, building a physical network that shows the identity of the mountain range and Valparaíso (Biblioteca CF + S, 2006).12 community gardens and a greenhouse for plants and reproduction of native trees have been created.3,000 people from various organizations visit the experience annually, proving its replicability. (CF + S Library, 2006)The experience is recognized and awarded regionally, nationally and internationally (TAC WEB Site).Qualitative results:Revaluation of the territory through the history and local identity of the hill (Fundación Habitat Colombia, 2005), generating the appropriation of the territory beyond the tangible, strengthening community ties and the practices of tolerance, solidarity and integration in difference (Observatory Latin American, 2004).Legitimate intervention model in the community, educational, governmental and academic world (CF + S Library, 2006).Continuity and permanence of networking for more than 21 years, promoting community participation in all intervention processes and a proactive civil society.Environmental awareness from the work done in the action of recovering the environment.Development of relationships of trust between public and community organizations (Biblioteca CF + S, 2006).Among the concrete effects that this experience has radiated is the initiative for the comprehensive and participatory restoration of the Working Population, led by young residents of the building who grew up participating in the work carried out by the TAC in the territory.This building is part of the collective history and identity of the hill, it was built in 1870, and corresponds to the first social housing built in Chile. From its beginnings its inhabitants were families of dock workers, whose descendants still live there. (Castillo, 2009). In 2005 it received the bicentennial seal, formalizing its status as a heritage building.This initiative dates back to 1998, when the young residents of the building decided to lead the directive of the working population, forming themselves as a community organization with the aim of starting a work to recover the building promoted from self-management. The first intervention was carried out from their own funds generated by activities promoted by the same community, in a second instance they are coordinated with the Proempleo program (municipal program for the generation of local employment) and receive state funds, where they manage to hire the same neighbors to start the recovery of the building (City of Valparaíso).In 2003, through an initiative of the TAC, a &quot;technical table&quot; was created where neighbors, neighborhood leaders, and public organizations were invited to participate, to address the challenge of recovering the building. This milestone begins a process of formalization of work from the community organization itself, regularizing and cleaning up the property titles that had been carried out for decades, an important task to resolve to access public funds. In this period they are formed as an organizing and technical assistance entity to apply for the Housing Solidarity Fund with the aim of carrying out the formal rehabilitation of the building. A year later they obtain the housing subsidies (Interview with Cristian Amarales).The working population was the protagonist in the development of the project from beginning to end, the board of directors was in charge of choosing the architects and construction companies.The building retains its original design, its modifications are to the interior of it, in terms of restoring the subdivision of apartments for the 34 resident families, where a separate bathroom and kitchen were considered for each of them, unlike its initial design in the which shared a service in the central courtyard, which generated a substantial change in the way of life of the families. The average surface area of apartments is between 55 and 90 m2, which exceeds the minimum standards of social housing that are currently being built in the country.This project received financing from MINVU, and funds generated from the organization&#39;s self-management through the Junta de Andalucía, owners and ValpoMío.Currently, the young people who led this process are organized as a corporation together with a network of organizations to recover the Santa Ana Chapel and later the Cordillera elevator. His vision is to show that the work from the articulation of actors and technical tables is a means to recover our territory, as mentioned by Cristián Amarales, leader and one of the managers of the initiative “... the challenge is to build a new model of public policy, replicable for other experiences ... ”.This way of doing local development is a learning apprehended in the experience lived in the TAC.Analysis and Lessons LearnedRegarding the analysis of the studied experience, we can say that a key strategy to achieve the reconstruction of the social fabric of the territory was the Associativity promoted by the TAC, from the articulation of the existing organizations in the locality, forming the Cordillera network, as platform of action and agents of transformation. Associative links bring together a diversity of views, learning, capacities, efforts and resources to achieve the common objectives proposed.It is recognized that one of the main achievements of the organization is linked to the relevance of the project. The TAC arises from the identification of needs and problems diagnosed by its own inhabitants and has been built at the pace of local processes, the improvement proposals have been made by its own actors, from the construction of spaces for collective participation that they have been strengthening local confidence and capacities.The TAC&#39;s work methodology has established new social practices that have been replicated in other organizations, including Associativity, local self-management, and the way of making participatory decisions and giving meaning to joint action based on “reflecting on the action&quot;.From this perspective, the sustainability of the experience goes beyond the limits of the organization, that is, learning becomes a collective knowledge, which can be applicable to other initiatives of different scales.A central value of the experience studied is its ability to generate spaces and contexts of social integration in the broad sense (diversity of trades, professions, cultures, place of origin), impacting beyond the local scale, becoming a transformative initiative in both people and social practices through the experience of joining and being part with others in a collective project that realizes community dreams ... In the words of the TAC “A space of realities and Dreams” where “Together a better life is built”.Among the weaknesses of the experience, the availability of economic resources is recognized, which are often insufficient and variable for the scope of the intervention (Latin American Observatory, 2004). These problems are overcome thanks to the self-management capacity in which the organization operates, as well as the support received by actors linked to the network.Secondary Sources and External LinksCF + S Library.

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose  Governments tend to use ineffective and obsolete citizen engagement methods that no longer stand up to scrutiny. At the same time, advancement in information and communications technology has made it possible to engage in legitimate, scalable democratic practices.PlaceSpeak’s vision is to improve the quality and legitimacy of decision-making and public policy development by modernizing authentication ofdigital identity, protecting privacy by design and ‘making it real’ and actionable with regards to public input. This requires a robust, secure, scalable and privacy enhancing digital identification and authentication ecosystem.  Their approach combines digital identity authentication with privacy by design principles to strengthen legitimacy in online public processes.  Origins and Development  Online citizen engagement is largely anonymous and not tied to place. This has led to the proliferation of trolls, sock puppets, astroturfing and other forms of online dysfunctions designed to skew and distort public opinion. Institutions that seem to have left “the people” out of the governing equation have deeply undermined the public trust.  PlaceSpeak was developed as a way to consult online and prove that it happened. Their location-based smart cities civic engagement platform aims to advance digital democracy by “ making it real ”.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  PlaceSpeak’s mission is to empower people everywhere to provide their verifiable feedback on public consultations by combining the values of a non-profit with the flexibility and innovation of a tech startup. They describe themselves as a new kind of company: a ""social enterprise,"" using the power of business for social good. Like most companies, PlaceSpeak has a business model that allows us to grow rapidly and be financially self-sustaining, providing thousands of people with a free public consultation platform. But unlike many companies, their business is social good.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  By connecting digital identity to residential address, PlaceSpeak provides geo-located feedback to public, private and nonprofit sector organizations, and closes the feedback loop between public consultation, evidence-based decision-making and accountability; engendering trust.  At the same time, PlaceSpeak enables a citizen-centred approach, leveraging the network effect.Using open data, PlaceSpeak delivers address-based notifications to keep residents informed, while providing opportunities to be consulted and involved,as well as encouraging collaboration, all of which ultimately empower citizens.  PlaceSpeak is revolutionizing the online public consultation business. Public consultation is required broadly as part of the democratic process. Governments at all levels directly or indirectly require consultation on a range of issues, most of which are geographically defined. PlaceSpeak taps into that need to consult and adds value by generating verifiable data to support public policy development and local decision-making. PlaceSpeak takes the guesswork out of online consultation.

Linda Maduz, at the Center for International and Comparative Studies, at the University of Zurich, argues that, ""direct democracy is a term denoting a variety of processes and institutions, guaranteeing people’s (direct) involvement in political decision-making"" [1].  Seattle's ""Occupy"" movement was begun by a diverse group of Seattleites who joined the nationwide Occupy movement. It started with the Occupy Wall Street resistance movement in New York City's Zuccotti Park. The movement began on September 17, 2011, protesting social and economic inequality [2]. Occupy Seattle argues that the problems that many of us are confronted with, are a result of the unfair distribution of wealth in America, leading to such economic and social inequality. The movement wants to focus elected officials, and the voting public on the majority's desire to “take our government and country back from the big-money interests that currently hold undue sway over the decisions that affect us all.” Participants are coming together in large numbers to effect this change. Their activity centers within the Seattle area, and although they share the consensus of the national movement, their efforts are limited to regional activities [3].  One clear purpose of the Occupy Seattle movement, and their direct democracy public assemblies, is to make the citizens of the greater Seattle area aware of the growing gap between the rich and the poor. G. William Domhoff, Professor of Sociology at the University of California, presented a series of graphs in his article ""Wealth, Income, and Power"" that explains the ""wealth"" breakdown in America. Domhoff's research pointed out that the top 1% only had 42.7% of the wealth, and 19% had 50.3%, leaving the remaining 80% with 7% of the wealth. When considering the research presented by Domhoff, it is evident that there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor. In support of the “Occupy” movement, Domhoff explains, ""that it will be a surprise and then some, because of a recent study (Norton &amp; Ariely, 2010) showing that most Americans (high income or low income, female or male, young or old, Republican or Democrat) have no idea just how concentrated the wealth distribution actually is"" [4].  Origins and Development  Occupy Seattle began with a demonstration at the Federal Building in downtown Seattle on September 26, 2011. The movement is a direct action demonstration activity, that was, and still is, inspired by the “Occupy America” movement. It first began in New York City when an organization known as “Occupy Wall Street” held their first public assembly, protesting against the financial greed and corruption in the Wall Street district of New York City. Not too long after that moment, the Occupy movement spread across America. By October 9, 2011, similar demonstrations were either ongoing or had been held in 70 major cities and over 600 communities across the U.S. [5]. The participants of this newly formed direct democracy are citizens from all across the U.S. who oppose the inequality of wealth, corporate greed, and the corruption of the banking and economic systems in America. They are calling on all Americans to speak out against the 1%, and for the 99% who are disenfranchised and charged with paying back the economic wrongs that the 1% created. Proponents of the Occupy movement cite the “big money interests” as those who are responsible [6]. Since its creation, as the numbers demonstrate, support for the ""Occupy"" movement has grown throughout the Puget Sound region [7].  Occupy Seattle's ""deliberative democracy"" has already begun challenging the Presidential election arena, as with the more recent demonstrations that were held during Rick Santorum's recent visit to Tacoma Washington. After he was faced with a handful of angry protestors who shouted through his entire event, he claimed that the “Occupy” movement was an example of “true intolerance.” This was in response to the tensions that flared when Santorum cited a recent decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals that California's same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. Later during an interview with Rebecca Kaplan, of CBS News, Santorum stated that what the protesters said, was, “that anybody who disagreed with them were irrational and the only reason they could possibly agree is they were a hater or a bigot,"" inflaming the crowd even more, which in turn led to several arrests [8].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  In the Occupy Seattle assembly forum, decisions are made through an open deliberative process of a “Direct Democracy” in the form of a public assembly. The members of the Occupy Seattle movement are made up of ordinary citizens of the city of Seattle and the surrounding regions.  Occupy Seattle is unique in the sense that the participant selects the ""Working Group"" that they find most interesting to them. Whether their interest is General Topics, Operations, Communication, Arts and Entertainment, or simply participating in the General Assembly, all they need to do is contact that group using the contact information provided on the Occupy Seattle website.  Joining Occupy Seattle means ""getting together and discussing lots of issues."" From General Assemblies, to Daytime Discussions, Occupy Seattle has events planned for most days of the week. Participants are asked to follow the rules of ""Accountability Principles and Process."" This informs the participant on how to handle conflict, harm, and violations of community agreements within their communities during a public assembly. It also informs the participant how to work together and listen over opposition and banishment, by having respect for the humanity of all individuals involved. Finally, it offers guidance on how to participate with transparency and responsibility within the community, paying close attention to the power dynamics of privilege and oppression [9].  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The ""Occupy"" movement in Seattle, and all across America, aims to address economic and social inequality through the deliberative process of public assembly. Their activities involve protest  demonstrations .Major Projects and Events  On October 1, 2011, Occupy Seattle's  very first official public assembly , the members clearly voiced their frustrations about the roles of government, corporations, and big banks all across American in an equal deliberative forum, in which they shared their own personal ideas and experiences with each other. Their cries for key values, and possible solutions took on an array of different views. In one such view, one woman spoke out contesting her discontent by crying out, ""Voting clearly didn't work, so we're taking to the streets and making it clear that people are upset."" Another participant stated, ""This is not right or left, this is right or wrong."" This example of an equal opportunity to voice their views, was clearly expressed when a megaphone was passed around to the various participants, giving each of them a chance to voice their opinions, and beliefs. One such participant in frustration went on to say, ""I'm ready for real democracy!"" Another cried out, ""I'm tired of the 1% telling us that were supposed to pay for this crisis, the one that they caused, we are the 99% and we want our country back."" This represents a unique way in which the Occupy Seattle movement has fostered equal deliberation. [10]A new agreement was recently passed in Occupy Seattle's General Assembly  on November 16, 2011, stating their policy on unity, solidarity, and debate. First and foremost, the occupy members have agreed that no irrational attacks can be made by any members of the General Assembly. Additionally, they focus actions around their main goal of defending each other and defending the movement within the realms of a healthy debate. Second, no negative actions are to be taken towards occupiers with opposing views that could damage their well being. However, a caveat to this rule may be applied if the occupier has external goals that go against the general unity and aspirations of the movement. Thirdly, no members are allowed to demonstrate any action that appears to be “fascist, racist, sexist, homophobic, white-nationalist populist, ageist, etc.” Finally, if a conclusion or new guidelines are decided upon, the General Assembly is the only governing body of the movement allowed to declare this action as an official Occupy Seattle decision. The General Assembly recognizes that individual occupiers may take their own stance, and although their actions will be supported, the occupiers must understand that the General Assembly holds the power to pass all official Occupy Seattle actions [11].  As recent as November 14th, 2011, The City of Seattle recognized the need of the Occupy Seattle members to peacefully practice their First Amendment rights. Council member Nick Licata supported the  passing of Resolution 31337 , a resolution recognizing and supporting, ""the peaceful and lawful exercise of the First Amendment as a cherished and fundamental right, in an effort to seek solutions for economically distressed Americans at federal and local levels."" The passage of this resolution fully supports the right of the Occupy Seattle members to peacefully protest the widening income gap that is affecting millions of Americans, by having their voices heard, with the hopes of eliminating unjust financial practices [12]. The goal in passing this resolution was to bring attention to the economic concerns of the 99%, in hopes that Congress will recognize it as an important agenda issue, as well as the need to reach a consensus on a solution. Resolution 31337 has also allowed the City of Seattle to foster ideas and solutions by investigating the structural causes currently in place. Continual further actions by the Seattle City Council, includes looking at the City’s current banking practices, their patterns in home foreclosures, as well as current initiatives that foster inequalities [13].  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Occupy Seattle has influenced those challenged during public assemblies. One such example was a year ago, when the leaders of the University of Washington's Foster School of Business booked JP Morgan Chase's CEO Jamie Dimon as the keynote speaker for their business leadership dinner. Protesters marched through the downtown of Seattle to the hotel where Dimon was speaking. JP Morgan Chase has been a recent target of the protestors, because of its acquisition of the former Washington Mutual Corporation, a buyout that put 3,400 Washington Mutual employees out of work, and left much of the former bank's downtown real estate empty. The protestors locked arms, and attempted to barricade the hotel entrances, while chanting and waving signs, stating, ""Prosecute the Real Thieves,” and ""What are profits if you lose your soul?"" Hoping to have some effect on the general public, through this peaceful, and legal public assembly. The Seattle Times and other local reporters talked to the JP Morgan Chase CEO before his speech that night, and he said he understood the protesters' frustration with Wall Street claiming, ""They're right, in general, these big institutions of America let them down,” acknowledging the ""occupiers"" discontent.  In another part of town earlier that day, activists surrounded a Chase bank, prompting clashes between protesters and police, leading to the arrests of five people suspected of trespassing. Police said in their report that at least 10 officers were physically assaulted while removing activists from the scene of the bank protest, with two suffering minor injuries. Additionally, pepper spray was deployed to push back the protesters at the bank.  Occupy's statement on that day was, ""We are hoping, that by our presence at the event where he is a keynote speaker, we will let him and the larger community know that the public is no longer tolerating the misdeeds of the big banks"" [14].  So what has Occupy Seattle accomplished? The strong proponents, as well as the participants themselves, say they have ""heightened awareness, struck a nerve with the American public,"" and that they are educating the people [15]. Just as with the passing of a resolution, giving the ""Occupiers"" the right to peacefully protest, or a large corporation's CEO candidly acknowledging the ""occupiers"" discontent over an issue, progress by the Occupy Seattle organization is subtle, but it is making a difference to the people of Seattle. Their voices are being heard.  Proponents of the “Occupy” movement argue that although the public assembly process, in a direct democracy forum, is healthy and rigorous, they also claim that little is accomplished at just one public assembly. They recognize that it can provide citizens a chance at voicing their opinions, frustrations, and possible solutions, however, they argue that one voice is not enough. Wezel McClellan, from Asheville, N.C., an active ""Occupier,"" offers younger participants advice based on his own experience during the civil rights movement. He tells them not to get discouraged, ""When you look back at what's really worked in history, none of it happened because one rally changed everything. You just have to keep fighting and speak up until you're heard"" [16].  Occupy Seattle is part of a growing movement all across America. It is a chance for those who would not ordinarily get involved, to play a part in a ""Deliberative Democracy,"" by interacting with fellow citizens who share the same beliefs, who also wish to voice their views.PublicationsDoes this organization publish reports, studies, or other media?

As a pioneer in the field of web-based dialogues, the company has sought to create and optimize cross-media communication between citizens and state for over ten years. Based on the belief in the power of good ideas that grow from the bottom, the company seeks to strengthen democratic processes through greater citizen participation. Zebralog has formulated a number of guidelines for 'good participation'.[1]  As a consultancy, Zebralog strives to enable private and public organizations to enter into a dialogue with citizens. As an agency, the company takes care of the technical implementation, and as an institute, Zebralog conducts research projects and provides expert opinions.  Origins and Development  When the founders of Zebralog met, the term ""online dialogue"" did not exist yet, at least not in Germany. At the end of the nineties, Matthias Trénel was investigating the success factors of discursive practices on the Internet at the Social Science Research Center in Berlin. Oliver Märker was working for GMD Research Center for Information Technology (now Fraunhofer Institute IAIS) in research projects to develop software that visualizes and structures argumentation. Hans Hagedorn was working as moderator of social discourse for the Hammerbacher consulting firm. When the three met each other at a workshop in 1999, entrepreneurial spirit was in the air. They were bursting with ideas and together developed visions of collaborative processes in politics, the Internet and society, as inspired by ideas from urban planning over psychology to IT.  First projects for the city of Esslingen and the Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development, as well as numerous publications followed. At this point of time, Daniela Riedel, who was working with Hans Hagedorn at the Internet Start Up City&amp;Bits, joined the team. In 2003, the newly expanded team registered their non-profit association under the name of Zebralog e.V. This allowed them to further develop online dialogues for the Berlin Senate Department for Urban Development as well as for other cities, state offices and ministries. Research institutes commissioned Zebralog e.V. with studies on e-participation. In 2007, the company started to transform the registered non-profit association Zebralog e.V. into a corporation and had become pioneers and experts in e-participation. To date, they are pioneers in shaping the digital society.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow who organized or funded this initiative? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and Tools  Zebralog offers comprehensive expertise from a single source. The organization provides individual advice throughout the whole participation process: from conception to implementation and evaluation. [2] Experienced online moderators structure the discussion and promote issue-oriented dialogue. The dialogue is continued at meetings,  workshops  and tours of the site. By consolidating and evaluating the results, Zebralog produces a detailed, goal-oriented image that accounts for different perspectives.Major Projects and Events  Zebralog has conducted more than 100 participation projects, notably municipal dialogues,  participatory budgeting  and  eConsultations .  For example, theCologne participatory budgeting[3] has won several national and international awards. The city of Cologne introduced its first participatory budget in 2008, becoming one of the first cities in Germany to do so. Every year since then, the citizens of Cologne have been given the chance to voice their ideas as well as to rate and comment on others’ suggestions concerning the best ways to spend and save money. In cooperation with the  Fraunhofer  Institute IAIS (Dr. Josef Wehner), Zebralog designs and realizes the Cologne participatory budgets.  Zebralog was also involved in implementing thecross-media municipal dialogue ""Dresdner Debatte""aimed at large-scale citizen participation regarding the structural development of Dresden's urban areas, particularly the central square that surrounds the Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady), an area known as the Neumarkt (New Market). The website  www.dresdner-debatte.de , an online forum open from June 8 to July 8, 2010, gave anyone interested in the debate a chance to weigh in with their opinion. Extensive information informed website visitors about the history and architecture of the Neumarkt. They could publish their ideas and wishes for the historic heart of the city by submitting their own proposal, or by joining discussions others’ proposals. In addition to the online platforms, an information box was set up on-site at the Neumarkt, in which citizens could ask questions and discuss their ideas and concerns with experts from the urban planning department of Dresden. In 2012, the project received a special award for ""sustainable participation"" at the administration congress ""Effizienter Staat"".  In 2011, Zebralog conducted an  eConsultation among students  on behalf of the Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Research of the Land North Rhine-Westphalia. Students of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) had the opportunity to raise their voices about study conditions at their university or college via the website (www.besser-studieren.nrw.de). More than 19,000 completed surveys and more than 14,000 student comments confirmed the necessity of offering this opportunity.  Zebralog has also written expert opinions, for example for the city of Vienna, and offers online platforms that help manage citizen concerns and complaints in cooperation with Mark-a-Spot.

The Alliance oversees the World Wide Views initiative which attempts to realize the group's mission through time-limited, global consultations on issues being debated or negotiated in international policy forums such as the UN. [1] The Alliance was also established to develop a method of simultaneous, multi-site public consultation. The method - simply called  World Wide Views  - was used for the first time in 2009 and twice more in 2012 and 2015.[2]  Origins and Development  The WWV Alliance was originally established by the  Danish Board of Technology  in 2009 to conduct the  World Wide Views Citizen Participation Project on Global Warming . Due to the success of the Project and the shared values of the partners, the Alliance continued its work on a second  Citizen Participation Project (on Biodiversity)  under the umbrella World Wide Views initiative. Since the first Project on Global Warming, the WWV consultation methodology has been used twice more: first on the topic of Biodiversity in 2012, and then on the  topic of Climate and Energy in 2015 .[1]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and Tools  Used first during the Project on Global Warming, the Alliance has continued to use and develop the  World Wide Views method  of citizen consultation. The method has thus far only been used at the international level but it is suitable for national or regional purposes. The process is focused on the idea of multiple, simultaneous public consultations on a given topic.

[6]  In general, the Bertelsmann Stiftung's work is ""grouped into programs, each of which is led by a member of [the] Executive Board.""[7] Projects are grouped by topic and activity, a list of which is available on the foundation's  website . The Board of Trustees, made of individuals interested in the organization's work with ""leadership experience and insight into social progress,"" acts as an advisory and controlling body. [7] In accordance with the articles of incorporation, the Board of Trustees supports the ""foundation’s ongoing development, oversees its executive management and, together with the Executive Board, makes decisions on matters of key importance.""[7]  Bertelsmann Stiftung is a privately operating foundation, so it funds its own philanthropic projects and initiatives via the Bertelsmann Group.[4]  As per Mohn's original conception, the ""foundation works in an interdisciplinary manner with researchers and experts in the field and maintains close contact with public and private institutions,"" striving to strengthen civil society.[2]  As a non-profit foundation, it is overseen by the district government of Detmold and engages in tax-privileged activities exclusively and directly in accordance with the relevant tax regulations.[5]Specializations, Methods and ToolsThe organization's ""objective is to promote research and understanding in the areas of religion, public health, youth and senior affairs, culture and the arts, public education and career training, social welfare, international cultural exchange, democracy and government, and civic engagement.""[8]  With each project, a proposed model or solution is developed, which the organization aims to then implement, with the help of relevant expert knowledge. The solutions subsequently become accepted practice in the relevant sector, are ""adapted for use by project partners or they continue to be jointly implemented within a cooperative framework.""[8]Major Projects and EventsAs of June 2020, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has 70 ongoing collaborative projects, where they engage in dialogue with international experts, institutions, and organizations.[9] More details on these projects can be found on their website. [10]One of their projects, the BTI Transformation Index ""analyzes transformation processes toward democracy and a market economy in international comparison and identifies successful strategies for peaceful change.""[11]Analysis and Lessons LearnedIn recent years, the Bertelsmann Stiftung has had to contend with criticisms regarding its non-profit status and growing political influence as well as its perceived neoliberalism. However, the organization maintains that it is politically neutral in nature and contests claims that it lacks democratic legitimacy.Want to contribute an analysis of this initiative?

Its mission is making the informed voice of everyday citizens heard — and making sure elected officials and politicians address the issues.  Jefferson Action is the 501(c)(4) partner of  the Jefferson Center.Origins and DevelopmentIn 1974, Minneapolis native Ned Crosby founded a think tank called  the Jefferson Center for New Democratic Processes,  Jefferson Action's partner organization. Named in honor of Thomas Jefferson, who believed that the American people are the ultimate source of power in our democracy – and that they will make the right decisions if they’re educated on the issues. The Jefferson Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, whereas Jefferson Action is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit.

Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and ToolsUsing the  Citizens Jury method , Jefferson Action holds Citizen Election Forums to develop specific policy recommendations and ensure that politicians and candidates respond the important issues their constituents have identified.Major Projects and EventsIn 2012, Jefferson Action embarked on an ambitious project to influence the conversation in a hotly contested congressional race. The project, named Reclaim November, used the Citizen Election Forum to evaluate Congressional candidates in Northeast Ohio.[1] Due to redistricting, two incumbent members of Congress were pitted against each other in Ohio's 16th Congressional District, Betty Sutton (D) and Jim Renacci (R).  Jefferson Action partnered with community groups, the media and academic institutions to hold three Citizen Election Forums in Ohio's 16th Congressional District. Each forum brought together 24 citizens randomly selected from the district assuring a demographically representative sample. These citizens studied the complexities of the economic issues facing the people of Ohio and evaluated the candidates responsiveness to addressing those issues.  Both Jim Renacci and Betty Sutton agreed to participate in the forum. After spending more than an hour talking to each of the candidates, the Forum participants issued an evaluation of the solutions the Representatives presented on the economic issue troubling Northeast Ohio.  The project received significant media attention, with more than 80 news stories in four months, including a dozen front page articles in the districts two most influential papers. The Reclaim November Ohio project also had a significant impact on the vote. Internal polling done by Jefferson Action showed that as much as 2.5 percent of voters reported the project influenced their vote. Jim Renacci, the winner of the election had a 4.2 percent margin of victory.  Jefferson Action approached Tina Nabatchi of Syracuse University to do an independent evaluation of the Reclaim November Project. She found the project excelled in a number of areas including overall participant satisfaction--both in terms of the overall outcome and the fair, unbiased way in which the project was conducted. Additionally, Dr. Nabatchi found that participants in the project had increased knowledge of the issues and on trust with government.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

It helps to builds the administrative capacity of local governments and to strengthen channels of communication between national and sub-national bodies to further devolve power to the local level, ultimately aiming to improve the quality of life for Tanzanians.[1]Origins and DevelopmentThe Ministry of Regional Administration and Local Government (MRLAG) was established by Article 8 (1) 145 and 146 in the 1977 Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania. In 1982, the Parliament of the United Republic of Tanzania passed the Local Government No 7 (Cap 287) Act and the City Authorities Act No. 8 (Cap 288), giving the Minister dealing with regional and local government authority over the establishment of District, Village, Minor, and Local Authorities. In 1990, the Ministry was renamed ""The Local Government Ministry, Social Development, Cooperation and Marketing."" In 1998, the work of the Ministry was transferred to the Prime Minister's office, renamed the Ministry for Regional and Local Governance (MRLG), and its work divided amongst two departments, one each for Regional and Local Government. In November 2000, the MRALG's work was transferred to the Presidential Office, becoming the PORALG. Five years later in December 2005, the Ministry was transferred back to the Prime Minister's Office before returning to the Office of the President in 2015.[2]Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingSince 2015, PO-RALG has been headed by a Minister, to whom the Permanent Secretary reports. Its various divisions focus on administration and human resources; government communication; procurement management; policy and planning; and finance and accounts, a unit headed by a chief accountant. [3] Finally, there is a chief internal auditor responsible for internal affairs. The government body is further subdivided into further divisions and units, which include a regional administration and local government division, and the full chart of these units is availablehere  . As a government body,the Ministry of Regional Administration and Local Government is publicly funded.Specializations, Methods and ToolsPO-RALG’s projects heavily featuredecentralizationto improve the delivery of services; their efforts involve transferring responsibilities and resources from the central government to local authorities to strengthen local institutions.[4] Additionally, they offer training resources for local officials and grassroots leaders.[5]Major Projects and EventsPO-RALG championsdecentralizationby devolving to local government authorities, and promotes community development in numerous policy areas, such as health[3], public transit[6], and education[7][8].Analysis and Lessons LearnedD.M.S. Mmari, Permanent Secretary of PO-RALG in 2005, argued that “local communities once empowered, have shown themselves capable of managing and accounting for funds disbursed to schools,” which seems to suggest some positive impacts of the organization’s decentralization efforts.[9] As a result of the PO-RALG’s education management initiatives, school fees for primary education were reduced, enrolment rate increased by over 30% from 2000 to 2004, and gender parity increased.[9] However, at the time of writing in 2005, Mwesiga also recognized the remaining work to be done to “sustain the successes.”[9]Similarly, Suleiman Ngware positively evaluated the Local Government Reform Programme implemented by PO-RALG, highlighting its successes while acknowledging the complexities of its goals of democratization, empowerment, and improved service delivery.[10] Ngware highlighted the impact on neighbouring nations as well, noting that delegations from Malawi, Zambia, Uganda, Kenya, and Nigeria have sent delegations to view the reform implementation and subsequently borrowed from its programme.[10]PublicationsDoes this organization publish reports, studies, or other media?

Activities of the INM are rooted in the core concepts of social justice and inclusion, respect for democratic values and the principles of sustainable development, in a spirit of open-mindedness and innovation. In its activities, the INM adopts a structured, deliberative three-pronged approach to contemporary issues: making needed information available, fostering informed  debate  and bringing forward proposals for positions or action.Origins and DevelopmentThe Institute was established in 2003 by a group of academics and figures from civil society brought together by Michel Venne, then (1990 to 2006) a journalist at the Montréal French-language newspaper, Le Devoir. The founders of the Institute believed that there was a crucial need for an institution that could effectively inform public debate and promote citizen participation on issues relating to the place, the role and the needs of a small nation like Québec in a globalized world.  The “New World” is first and foremost the Americas, the physical territory of which Québec is part. The expression also evokes the idea of world renewal, as exemplified by the spirit of explorers and discoverers. Another of the goals of the INM is precisely that: to explore and open up new horizons and celebrate successes, but also to look long and hard at the shortcomings, failures and needs of Québec society, relative to the rest of the world. The INM’s work is based on the firm conviction that the renewal of ideas entails citizen participation, because the introduction of new ideas cannot be the sole prerogative of experts or interest groups.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and ToolsActivities of the INM centre around three key themes.Key Theme 1: Development of Citizenship SkillsThe INM works to foster “citizenship attitudes” and contribute to the development of citizenship skills for individuals and organizations. It develops transferable expertise, conducts ongoing monitoring of citizen participation and organizes activities designed to  educate , train and mobilize individual Quebeckers or support their involvement in community action, in particular through its annual Summer and Winter Schools for young people between the ages of 15 and 35. The Institute runs information campaigns and takes public stands on questions of participation and democracy. In addition, through its consultancy service (INM services-conseil), it also provides services to help organizations, businesses and institutions establish quality “participatory spaces”. The Institute’s organizational services are based on the best collaborative practice models known.Key Theme 2: Promotion of ongoing debate on key issues for Québec societyThe INM advocates ongoing debate on key issues for Québec society. One illustration of this position is its creation of an open and easily accessible Agora or citizen think-tank. Quebeckers learn about participation by personally engaging in discussions on important public issues, knowing that the results of those discussions can potentially influence public policy or private initiatives. And the more they participate, the more they want to pursue their participation.  The Agora has five basic components:Ongoing observation of the evolution of Québec society and identification of issues that call for debate (in particular, through an advisory panel of publicly respected figures and publication annually of the almanac: L’état du Québec (meaning: The State of Québec – not available in translation), an annual overview of Québec society;  Information-gathering and, where relevant, production and dissemination of the information people need to participate in informed debate on current issues (preparation of theme-based kits on subjects such as health, the economy, culture, demography, mining development);  Organization of deliberative democracy activities ranging from simple  round-table discussions  to structured exchanges over a period of several months, known as Strategic Rendez-Vous;Dynamic  and engaged facilitation of a web-based forum for discussion;  Active promotion of the ideas, projects and proposals arising from the discussions and debates it initiates, by communicating them to the general public and to policy-makers and by encouraging further reflection on outcomes (using instruments such as reports, reviews, publications, declarations, etc.).Key Theme 3: Promotion of citizen participation, an essential component in the exercise and development of democratic rightsThe INM conducts a range of structured reflection and promotion activities on issues relating to democracy and citizen participation. It collects and makes available information on the current state of knowledge on democracy and citizen participation. It brings together diverse  stakeholders  for discussions on public participation, consultation mechanisms and the relationship between participatory and representative democracy. It engages in public debate on the way institutions are evolving and on the exercise of democratic rights, prepares advisory briefs and may, on occasion, take positions on questions of public policy, private sector initiatives, or current issues or events involving citizen participation, the way democratic institutions function, or the organization of participatory processes. The Institute also promotes citizen participation through its involvement in national or international issue tables or coalitions of relevance to its mission, and through its public presence and as part of a communications strategy that uses both traditional news media and  social media  to reach different target networks.Major Projects and EventsKey Theme 1: Skills development for individual citizens and for organizationsWorking with individual citizensCitizenship Schools: Summer and Winter SchoolsSince 2004, the INM has offered Summer Schools on Citizenship to young people between the ages of 15 and 35. Over a five-day period, they can hear presentations and participate in round table discussions, seminars and  workshops , all designed to enhance their knowledge or understanding of the major issues of our times and help augment their citizenship skills.  In a convivial and relaxed atmosphere, some five to seven hundred participants discuss current issues and define the kind of world they want to live in.  In winter, Québec college students between the ages of 17 and 20 can attend the Winter School that the INM has now organized since 2007.  Further information is available (in French only) at  http://www.inm.qc.ca/programmes/ecole-deteÀ go, on change le monde! – Social EntrepreneurshipSince 2007, in association with the Caisse d’économie solidaire Desjardins, the INM has supported and promoted social entrepreneurship projects undertaken by young Quebeckers. Social entrepreneurs are people who propose practical and innovative solutions in response to social issues and who apply entrepreneurial principles in the creation and management of projects with pronounced social impacts, while ensuring community involvement in the process.  The program, À go, on change le monde! offers young social entrepreneurs a range of different forms of support: access to information or advice, financial assistance, references to professional services, a mentoring network and a young social entrepreneurs’ club.  A further goal of the program is the development of increased public awareness of the role played by young social entrepreneurs in Québec.  Further information is available (in French only) at:  http://www.agoonchangelemonde.qc.ca/Working with organizations : INM services-conseilThe Institut du Nouveau Monde provides four kinds of services to organizations: process support, facilitation of consultations or events, training workshops and lectures or presentations.Process supportINM’s consultancy service can provide needed support to organizations looking for significant results around a variety of processes: carrying out consultations involving citizen participation, establishing innovative internal working groups, organizing an event designed to provoke reflection and identify priorities, or wanting guidance around a forecasting and strategic planning process. INM services-conseil can play a facilitation role for a process already under way or help plan the different steps needed for a given project.Group facilitationEffective facilitation happens when the serious goal of having a group jointly come to meaningful conclusions is achieved through the use of a relaxed and fun-filled approach. INM services-conseil offers added-value service in that it can suggest the use of less familiar discussion methods which nonetheless produce tangible results: open forums,  café conversations , 4-6 huddles, buzz sessions, the scenario technique, etc. In addition, the service works with a range of innovative and creative approaches such as social intervention theatre, street animation and video screenings to highlight particular issues, while also using more traditional facilitation methods, where appropriate.Training workshopsDue to its expertise and use of participatory activities such as role-playing, experience-based approaches, round tables and situation simulation techniques, the INM has come to be recognized as a leader in its field. For questions on how best to communicate publicly, craft powerful messages or generate creative ideas, for looking more deeply into issues such as participatory local governance or any other issue relevant to the INM’s mission, the consultancy team can propose innovative approaches that will help participants better understand and retain the information they have been given.Lectures or presentationsINM services-conseil has speakers available for lectures or presentations in a variety of different formats to explain the results of the Institute’s reflections and practices on the question of citizen participation. Alternatively, it can also draw on outside resources if a client organization would prefer to hear a range of points of view on a topic, give participants the opportunity to form their own potentially opposing opinions, and so spark debate on a subject.  Further information on INM services-conseil is available (in French only) at:  http://www.inm.qc.ca/services-conseilExamples of projects undertaken for outside organizationsCitizens’ juryAt the request of the Director General of Elections for Québec (DGEQ), the Institut du Nouveau Monde organized in January 2010 a citizens’ jury on the issue of the funding of political parties by private firms or other groups. Members of the jury first attended hearings where expert witnesses presented a range of background information on the topic, then deliberated together before submitting their advice to the DGEQ.  Further information is available (in French only) at:  http://www.inm.qc.ca/jury-citoyen.htmlTout le monde à tableStaff and the travelling nutritionist from the Tout le monde à Table convoy travelled around the 17 regions in Québec to meet with a range of Québec families in different parts of the province. They wanted to get input from parents of children between 0 and 12 on issues around food and eating, such as the pleasures of eating well, eating together as a family and meal preparation. The information collected from the parents has been used by public health workers, elected policy-makers, the food industry and consumer groups to support the development of effective strategies for healthy eating.  Further information is available (in French only) at:  http://www.toutlemondeatable.org/Agenda 21 for CultureThe development of Québec’s Agenda 21 for Culture was the responsibility of the province’s then Ministère de la Culture, des Communications et de la Condition féminine. Québec’s Agenda 21 for Culture is a 21-point framework for action designed to spur a renewed vision of cultural development. Through its organization of corresponding public events and management of the project website, the Institute played a leadership role in the development of a comprehensive dialogue around the topic, as well as providing input for the final version of the document.  Further information is available at:  http://www.agenda21c.gouv.qc.ca/Province-wide citizen forums for the Bouchard-Taylor CommissionTwo respected Québec intellectuals and specialists in cultural diversity, Doctors Gérard Bouchard and Charles Taylor, were appointed in 2008 to head this historic Commission.  The two co-presidents commissioned the Institut du Nouveau Monde to organize four province-wide citizen consultation forums. Based on its expertise in organizing structured opportunities for productive citizen debate, the INM recommended the use of interactive events on different themes around cultural differences and the concept of “reasonable accommodation”, as a way to encourage all Quebeckers to voice their opinions on the key issues involved.Key Theme 2: Promotion of ongoing public debatePublicationsL’état du Québec:  Aimed at a general (non-specialist) readership, it provides a comprehensive portrait of Québec’s political, economic, cultural and social situation for the current year, together with the most recently available statistics.Dynamic organization of broad-based consultation and debateStrategic Rendez-Vous ForumsThe purpose of the INM’s Strategic Rendez-Vous forums is to encourage open and informed debate between experts and members of the community, so as to map out a shared vision of the Québec they want and the kind of world they want to be in, twenty years from now.  The Institute uses a three-pronged approach: making needed information available, fostering informed debate and bringing forward proposals for positions or actions.  A steering committee of experts in the field proposes the questions to be debated and identifies relevant and easily understandable documentation. In each of the regions of Québec, community members are invited to take part in the debate on the issues identified. They meet again at the end of the process to finalize orientations and adopt proposals for concrete action. Outcomes from each of the Strategic Rendez-Vous forums take the form of recommendations communicated to the public and presented to both stakeholders and authorities in the community concerned. Strategic Rendez-Vous forums have so far been organized around topics ranging from the economy and health to culture and intergenerational issues.  Further (French only) information on the two topics currently being debated (the first, social inequalities, and the second, democracy and citizen participation) can be found (in French only) at:  http://www.inm.qc.ca/inegalites/presentation  and at  http://www.inm.qc.ca/democratie/presentationPublic conversations on the future of mining in QuébecThe Institute’s Public Conversations on the Future of Mining in Québec were held to objectively and impartially identify for the general public the main issues arising from the exploration and extraction of mineral resources in Québec, in addition to providing an open forum where citizens and community stakeholders could raise questions, express their concerns and, most importantly, explore potential solutions.  In this way, the INM gives Québec citizens, organizations concerned about these issues and public policy-makers the opportunity to obtain information within an objective framework and engage in open-minded debate with others on the issue.  Further information (French only) is available at:  http://www.inm.qc.ca/avenir-minierThe Future of Higher EducationQuébec witnessed unusually high levels of mobilization and unrest in Spring 2011. The provincial government subsequently acknowledged the need to re-establish a climate for dialogue by organizing a Summit on Higher Education.  In keeping with the spirit of the pre-Summit process, the INM invited Québec citizens to join the collective reflection process. A total of four forums were held to allow Quebeckers of all ages and backgrounds to give their views about what higher education in Québec should be in the 21st century. A summary of the discussions in these forums was presented in a report to the Minister of Higher Education, in advance of the Summit.  To the same end, a special Summit-focused Winter School was held for Quebeckers between the ages of 15 and 35.  Further information (French only) is available at:  http://www.inm.qc.ca/enseignement-superieur/presentationKey Theme 3: Promotion of citizen participation, an essential component in the exercise and development of democratic rightsThe following are some examples of the approaches used to support INM's different activities.Social Innovation Laboratory - LABISLABIS is a process designed to encourage social innovation in response to complex social problems. It is organized in several stages and brings together stakeholders or citizens who embark on a collective reflection about issues to be addressed, using a deliberative approach that allows for complexity, creativity and diverging views of the future. The group first considers people’s different personal perceptions and realities, then jointly develops a comprehensive vision on which to base target strategies and innovative projects.  Further information is available at:http://inm.qc.ca/nos-activites/labis-laboratoire-dinnovation-sociale.htmlOpen ForumThis approach allows participants in an event to design their own personal participation plans. Free of time constraints, and coming and going as they please, they develop personalized schedules, propose topics, and become involved in discussions of interest to them. The activity evolves in parallel with the rhythm of the resulting discussion circles, whose members are constantly changing. The goal of the experience is for participants to imagine innovative solutions to problems faced by their organizations, and allow them to see these problems differently as a result of the Open Forum approach.Scenario TechniqueThe Scenario Technique is a local deliberative forum that brings together representatives of a range of different groups (political decision makers, private-sector representatives, technical experts, resident citizens, etc.), all of whom have some degree of expertise in their respective communities. This mixed group is divided into teams which identify positive and negative scenarios for given future situations. Participants reflect on the difficulties encountered, draw up their own scenarios, then together design a local plan of action.4-6 HuddlesA 4-6 Huddle is a perception and information sharing technique aimed at clarifying an issue in a context conducive to in-depth  deliberation  and debate. The method was developed as an ice-breaking activity for group events and takes the form of rounds of four to six huddles formed by four to six participants who change with every round.Café ConversationsCafé Conversations provide opportunities for exchange, debate and dialogue among different people concerned or affected by particular issues. Working in groups of four to eight, people take part in rounds of discussion on one or several topics. The groups work simultaneously in the same room but participants change tables after each round, so as to spread ideas and extend discussion. The event ends with a plenary session, where the main ideas and conclusions developed in the discussions are presented to all participants.Citizen CaravansCitizen Caravans are a “street happening” technique used to stimulate reflection on current issues among people of all backgrounds and ages. Activities are playful, lively, and short-lasting. They are held in public spaces, such as streets, shopping centres or festivals, etc. where people can freely come and go. They are designed to appeal to children, teenagers and adults alike.  The Caravans are results-based activities developed as an improved tool for taking the pulse of citizens on a range of topics. Street events are performed by actors equipped with portable suitcases stocked with a vast array of stimulating and amusing props developed by the INM.Buzz SessionsEach Buzz Session brings together small groups of people who, within a short period of time, must complete a task focusing on a particular problem. The tight deadline creates a sense of urgency that drives the group to propose ideas “in the rough” which, while not fully developed, nevertheless contribute to exploration of the subject under consideration.Panels orCitizens’ JuriesA citizens’ jury is a group of twenty or so randomly selected people who can contribute to the political decision-making process. Participants are asked to examine and debate an important public policy issue. By the final stage of the process, the group is expected to be able to come to a collective decision on the subject.  Citizens’ juries are often established when decision-makers feel trapped in the gridlock created by strongly divided public opinion and conflicting interests. To start with, needed background information is presented to the jury, which first debates the issue, then formulates recommendations that can be drawn on by policy-makers in the decisions they will later take.Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe work carried out by the Institute has led to an increase in citizen participation in the democratic life of Québec. The organization is strongly committed to the broad dissemination of information on issues of importance for Québec, to advocating ongoing public debate on these issues and to promoting the ideas and projects resulting from that debate in the public arena and among decision-makers.  By increasing citizen participation, the INM has helped transform the political culture of Québec, as well as legitimizing and showing the value of this kind of participation. At the same time, it is developing and applying new approaches, building up a wealth of transferable knowledge and creating models for dialogue and participation that can be drawn on to change the behaviours of opinion-leaders in Québec society and reform existing democratic institutions. The INM has led Quebeckers to develop a taste for democratic activism.  Some results of the INM’s work: in numbers and in public recognition:  Through its various activities, the INM now reaches more than 20,000 people every year. Some 15,000 receive the Institute’s newsletter and 350 people are registered members of the organization.  Since 2004, around 5,000 young people have participated in citizenship education activities in the context of the INM’s Summer and Winter Schools. Over a five-day period, they interact around presentations, round table discussions, seminars and workshops. The entire process is designed to help them increase their knowledge and understanding of the major issues of our time, while also learning civic skills. The INM’s Summer School was recognized in 2008 as a key component in Québec’s Youth Action Strategy, for a period of five years. Furthermore, in 2010, the Summer School received one of three prizes awarded by the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, for its outstanding civic education practices. Lastly, in 2011, the same Summer School was identified as one of the ten most innovative and promising projects among the 300 projects supported by the Montréal Island Youth Forum.  Since 2007, as part of the program À go, on change le monde!, more than 900 young entrepreneurs have been able to receive information, advice, financial assistance and references to professional services, call on a network of mentors and join a young social entrepreneurs’ club.  Since 2004, over 12,000 people have participated in citizen forums organized as part of the Strategic Rendez-Vous program.  In 2007, the Executive Director of the Institute was appointed by the Government of Québec to the position of Vice Chair of the Working Group on the Québec Health System, an appointment stemming from the work carried out by the INM in 2005 on the reform of the Québec health system. The results of the Institute’s analyses and consultations were presented to the World Health Organization (WHO) which subsequently drew upon the INM’s expertise for work the WHO carried out in collaboration with the Ministries of Health of Portugal and Tunisia.  Since 2006, the INM has worked closely with ACFAS (Association francophone pour le savoir, a French-language multidisciplinary learned society), to support its organization of conferences for exchanges and the advancement of research on the theme of citizen participation. Over this period, more than 250 researchers and practitioners have met and discussed their work and approaches to it.  In 2005, the INM was awarded the Claire Bonenfant Prize for Citizenship, an honour bestowed by the Government of Québec in recognition of the promotion of democratic values and citizenship education.  Since the Institute’s creation in 2003, its influence has increasingly come to be recognized outside Québec as well as within the province. One example of this recognition was the fact that, in the three years between 2010 and 2012, the INM was responsible for organizing the World Assembly of Civicus, the Global Alliance for Citizen Participation, an annual forum attended by some 1,000 NGOs from all parts of the world.  The Executive Director of the Institute is also a Fellow of the Carold Foundation for the advancement of citizenship in social change, at both the national and international levels, in addition to being a member of the Ashoka network of social entrepreneurs (a group that includes some 2,500 of the most outstanding social innovators in the world).PublicationsL’état du QuébecThe INM puts out an annual French-language flagship publication, L’état du Québec, a compilation reference aimed at a general (non-specialist) readership and providing a comprehensive portrait of Québec’s political, economic, cultural and social situation for the current year, together with the most recently available statistics.  Further information (in French only) on this book, available in bookstores throughout Québec, can be found at:  http://www.letatduquebec.qc.caA number of supplements to this same publication are prepared for use in INM program activities. The Institute also publishes a magazine on social entrepreneurship, À go! (in French only).  See AlsoCafé conversationsCitizens’ JuryReferencesThis entry is missing citations.

They are working to transform how people envision democracy, and to develop innovative ways for even the largest organizations, communities, and governments to be truly democratic—not just in theory or in name, but in practice.  By putting into practice more inclusive and participative forms of government, they aim to work on a social level to foster individuals that are both engaged and capable of working with those different from themselves. The organization believes this underpins not only the political change  toward  a better democracy, but also the long-term success of  democracy itself .Origins and DevelopmentFounded in Bolivia in 2013,  Democracy In Practice  helps transform open-minded groups and communities into laboratories of democratic innovation where new approaches to governance can be experimented with and developed. They then share the insights and ideas generated by this experimentation in order to inspire others to see democracy in new ways.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and ToolsKnow what areas this organization specializes in or what methods and tools they use? Help uscomplete this section!Major Projects and EventsDemocratic experimentation is currently underway in the  student governments of three schools in Cochabamba, Bolivia.  Typically, student governance mirrors the basic structure of adult governance: a few students seek nomination, run one-day campaigns, and hold elections. After the votes are cast, the vast majority of students are excluded from further participation. Instead,  Democracy In Practice  is helping students – in their first encounter with ‘democracy’ – experiment with new approaches that are more inclusive, representative, and effective.  One such approach involves random selection and rotation. In these schools  Democracy In Practice  has replaced candidates and elections with  lotteries  in which students are randomly selected to assume temporary positions within the student government. After limited terms, these students rotate out and are replaced by other randomly selected students so that, over time, all students (even the shyest and least popular among them) have the chance to work as part of a team, assume responsibilities, and serve their peers and school as student-leaders. Combining random selection with rotation ensures that the student governments broadly represent the diversity within each student body (e.g. gender, age, and ethnic differences) instead of a single clique or type of student, and allows more students to participate directly.  Putting these innovative approaches to the test means encouraging and empowering students to improve their school community in concrete ways that they identify. To that effect, randomly selected student governments have organized enjoyable events such as school-wide field trips and theater competitions, while also addressing complex problems like the need for more sustainable waste-disposal systems, the lack of a school library, and the high cost of transportation to and from school. Beyond tackling challenging issues within the structure of these new approaches to government, the organization is also pushing students to take ownership of the design itself, direct the experimentation with different democratic practices and processes themselves, and develop their own original ideas.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

It values its independence as it believes it to be one of its greatest assets.""[2] Six months after its launch, VouliWatch attracted the attention of international foundations and begun receiving project-based grants by the Open Society Foundation. In November 2015, VouliWatch ran a  crowdfunding  campaign on Indiegogo and raised more than 12,000 euros [4].

[1] The organization aims to find and amplify local resources available for and from grassroots leadership and organisations, by developing environments for sharing and exchanging information, knowledge, and experience as well as coordinating on issues of urgent and long-term concern. [2]  Origins and Development  In 2009, Micha Kurz and Khaled Farrag, an Israeli and a Palestinian activist, realized that in Jerusalem, a platform for civil action against house demolitions, evictions, and settlement activities was missing. The initial idea behind Grassroots Jerusalem was to provide a space for Palestinian activists to exchange, coordinate, and deliberate. Secondly, the founders understood that Palestinian community voices in Jerusalem are not heard on political levels. In 2011,  Grassroots  opened the  Markaz Al Kul  (Centre for All) community center in Sheikh Jarrah, an East Jerusalem neighborhood, with the support of Dan Church Aid and the European Commission.  Grassroots  quickly established lasting partnerships with over half the Palestinian communities in Jerusalem, building strong relationships with leaders and community-based organizations (CBOs). Since 2011, new community maps have been designed and visions and implementation plans have been developed within each partner community. An online information source for the coordination of humanitarian development and advocacy was implemented and a ‘Legal Clinic’, providing legal advice for Palestinian Jersualemites, was established. In 2013, the NGO expanded and moved into its present political community center which it named  AlMarsa —The Harbour.  Despite its Israeli-Palestinian founding figures,  Grassroots  is a Palestinian organization working with Palestinian communities only. The rationale is that peaceful co-existence is an unworkable idea in a situation of occupation and continuous dispossession. Co-existence in that sense invites the occupied to acquiesce to their situation of rightlessness. Regarding the idea of co-existence as a normalization of the occupation,  Grassroots  discourse, accordingly, strongly prioritizes freedom and ending the occupation. [3]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and Tools  To realise their vision, Grassroots Jerusalem has developed three interlocking pillars (Mapping and Assessment, Local Mobilisation, Global Mobilisation) that support their platform for community development and advocacy. Together, they provide a platform for change agents to develop their own capacity and enable the development of their communities. [2]  With its  mapping  activities, Grassroots  aims to communicate the realities of spatial control, to identify issues of shared concern, and to provide the information necessary for community members to connect, coordinate and advocate.  Grassroots works towards realizing the latent capacity of Palestinian civil society by visually mapping the seemingly disparate spatial moments of suppression and highlighting patterns of resistance and self-representation in collaborative mappings. [3]  Major Projects and EventsKnow what projects or events this organization has led or supported? Help uscomplete this section!Analysis and Lessons LearnedGrassroots  has built an organization that is anchored in the great majority of Jerusalem’s Palestinian communities. It has become a hub and a public space for community organization in the city.  Grassroots , however, aims higher. The level to be reached, as one of its full-time employees says, is that “nobody can ignore the communities anymore”—neither Israel, with its continued annexation and settlement politics in what it regards as its “undivided capital”, nor the Palestinian leadership itself, nor those international actors whose influence weighs heavy on the conflict. [3]Grassroots  is a political organization operating in a politically charged environment. Thus, some communities had problems accepting  Grassroots  as an organization whose leadership is both Israeli and Palestinian. The joint Palestinian-Israeli management sometimes gives the impression that the organization works by the values of co-existence. To Palestinians, this is considered as normalization of the occupation, and under this wrong impression, they might refrain from working with the organization. However, the work of  Grassroots  can overall be considered a success. The NGO has gained trust within the communities by not advocating pre-defined political goals, but rather strictly following the lead of the community interlocutors themselves. Rather than only giving the organization its name, the grassroots-approach truly lies behind the success of the NGO. [3]Want to contribute an analysis of this organization?

It monitors government progress in this regard, particularly to ensure access for the poor and vulnerable populations. Their mission is to work towards a South Africa where the constitution is upheld and human rights are recognized in law and respected in practice and the government is accountable and responsive to the people.  Origins and Development  The organisation has a long history of working against injustice in the country. The Black Sash was established in 1955 by a small group of white middle-class women (who were predominantly English-speaking) when they formed an organization called The Women's Defence of the Constitution League. Founder members were Jean Sinclair, Ruth Foley, Elizabeth McLaren, Tertia Pybus, Jean Bosazza and Helen Newton-Thompson (among others). The organisation was formed as a protest to oppose the Senate Bill that aimed to remove coloureds from the common voter’s role as the women of Black Sash believed this action was against the ‘spirit' of the constitution. Though the organisation was established as means to highlight the unconstitutional actions taken by the apartheid government, it became a platform for liberal women to oppose the apartheid policies through  protests,  marches and vigils. The name Black Sash originated from the women’s use of black sashes as a symbol to mourn the death of the constitution.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and Tools  The organisation currently works in three main areas, rights-based information, education and training, community monitoring, and advocacy in partnership. The Black Sash publishes historical archives and activities from their advice offices and fieldwork activities as part of their educational campaigns. Black Sash has advice offices across the country, including a helpline where the public can ask questions on any matter regarding human rights. Their activities include advocacy work, where they engage government on behalf of communities, as well as  monitoring government action  in terms of ensuring access to rights. Their first advice office was opened in Cape Town during apartheid in an effort to assist victims of apartheid legislation within lawful means. The organisation’s activities continue to help communities across South Africa.  One of the Black Sash's most effect methods of community empowerment has been their unique approach to community-based monitoring.  Developed and piloted  with  Making All Voices Count  and  Code for South America , the  Black Sash CBM model  involves the formation of partnerships with both community-based organisations (CBOs) and government in order to strengthen the role of civil society in improving service delivery and holding public and private sectors to account.  Major Projects and Events  The Black Sash has been involved in a variety of projects, including:  Community Monitoring  and Advocacy, Reproductive Maternal and Child Health projects, and the Making All Voices Count community-based monitoring project to mention a few.Community Monitoring and AdvocacyThe Community Monitoring and Advocacy project was implemented by driven communities through civil society organisations, who supported and trained volunteers as monitors in the project. The project identified the South African Social Security Agency, Department of Health, Department of Home Affairs and municipalities for monitoring.Reproductive Maternal and Child Health ProjectThe purpose of the Reproductive Maternal and Child Health project is to assist government in ensuring access to reproductive healthcare services and improve the quality of service particularly for the poor. The project aims to:Support districts to oversee improvement of MNCH services.  Strengthen delivery of school health, ward-based primary health care, and obstetric and neonatal emergency services.  Improve demand and accountability for MNCH services.  Document and disseminate new knowledge to remove barriers to the uptake and access to MNCH servicesMaking All Voices Count Community-Based MonitoringThe Making All Voices Count project is part of a global initiative which aims to empower Community Based Organisations to take ownership of and participate actively in citizen-based monitoring of three government services in 20 service sites across South Africa.

The goal was advancing the needs of citizens through engagements with government that ensure citizen participation for the promotion of a government that is effective and listens to the people. Ultimately, Making All Voices Count intended to foster changes that allow all people, including the poor and marginalised, to engage with public and private institutions and call them to account over the issues that matter to them most. The organization's projects developed and improved community capacity to encourage the practice of active citizenship that generates results.  Origins and Development  Making All Voices Count was founded in June 2013 with the intent to run for four years. While the organization's activities were officially concluded in 2017, it continues to publish final reports on its work.  Making All Voices Count worked in 12 countries in Africa and Asia, primarily in Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, the Philippines, South Africa, and Tanzania. The program was initiated with a clearly defined set of aims, a theory of change and a structure centred on four linked components – innovation, scaling, research and evidence, and catalysing global action. The programme has carried out activities under each of components.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Making All Voices Count was run by a team of 24 individuals made up from each of its partner organizations:Hivos (an international non-governmental organisation supporting people who are systematically blocked from rights, opportunities and resources), Ushahidi (a group pioneering technology-for-development organisation) and the Institute for Development Studies (a global institution for development research, teaching and learning, and impact and communications, based at the University of Sussex in the UK).  MAVC's organizational team worked out of their partner offices in South Africa, Kenya, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Indonesia.  The organization recieved funding from the Department for International Development (DFID), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the Omidyar Network (ON).  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Making All Voices Count supported creative and cutting-edge solutions – many of which use mobile and web technology – to amplify citizen voices, mobilize communities, and enable governments to listen and respond.  Activities of the organization included:Making grants to support innovation and technology that has the potential to support better governance.  Conducting research that helps to build a base of evidence about what works and why in using innovation for accountable governance  Working with policy makers, opinion formers and influencers to ensure that their learning contributions have impact across the sector  Educating and empowering organizations, communities, and individualsMethods, Tools and Techniques deployed by the organization in service of their activities and work included:Community-based monitoringParticipatory researchVoter information servicesSurveys and pollsParticipatory budgetingMapping  and  participatory rural appraisalMajor Projects and Events  Making All Voices Count is involved in a range of projects across the globe that are aimed at improving citizen engagement and government responsiveness.For the four years it was active between 2013 and 2017, the organization developed and implemented programmes to increase government transparency, fight corruption, and empower citizens. Through partnerships with other NGOs and community-based organizations like Code for South Africa, MAVC experimented with new technologies to make government more effective and accountable.

These and other challenges affect millions of people around the world without many citizens of any age getting involved in facing them.[1] Design for Change is an initiative that seeks to engage people in problem solving in their communities at the school level,  empowering children such that they graduate ""with crucial  21st Century Skills  ofc  ollaboration, critical thinking, creativity, and empathy"", thereby equipping them to face the aforementioned challenges.[2]The initiative responds to the question “How can we help our children develop passion for knowledge and compassion for the world around them? How can make people believe that children are not helpless? That change is possible and they can drive it?”  The direct purpose of Design for Change is to recognize that children are capable of being socially aware and proactive change agents in their community.[3] For that purpose, there is a need to promote a learning environment that focuses on passion and compassion, collaboration, empathetic thinking, problem-solving, and confidence.[4]  The initiative proposes that “to impact a positive transformation in the environment, we need to design solutions with individuals, rather than for them. Design thinking gives us tools and skills that enable us to stop assuming and start engaging, empathizing and understanding. It helps us move from the current-state to a preferred-state – for ourselves as well as for others.”[5] Design for Change “equips children with the tools to be aware of the world around them, believe that they play a role in shaping that world, and take action toward a more desirable, sustainable future.”[6] It teaches children that they do not have to be rich or strong or powerful to make change happen.  Origins and Development  While trying to empower people to manage the challenges their communities face, Kiran Bir Sethi founded ‘The Riverside School’ in Ahmedabad, India, in 2001, and ‘Design for Change’ in 2009. As the initiative explains,  “she started this movement with a conviction that if young people were empowered and made to feel that they could take matters into their hands, they would change the world for the better. Kiran relied heavily on her background as an Industrial Designer to pilot the very first design-thinking guide for young people across India.”[7]  Kiran Bir Sethi narrates that when her 6-year-old son had the word “choice” removed from his vocabulary by a teacher, she began thinking of bringing it back in. In India, while 200 million children go to school, only 18 million go to college from which 90% do not have necessary employment skills. She felt that they had been filled with the feeling of “I can ́t”. So as a designer, she aimed to design an approach to education that would equip children with the tools to be able to say “I can” instead of “I can’t”, founding The Riverside School in Ahmedabad, India in 2001. Within the next ten years, the Riverside School students outperformed the top 10 schools in India. Because it was working for the 350 children that were part of that private school, Kiran Bir Sethi decided to expand it in 2009.[8] From March to June – when they launched it- everything was design on the go and put in very simple guide with four simple steps:  “FEEL any problem that bothers you, IMAGINE a way to make it better, DO an act of change and SHARE your story of change with the world. She believed the Feel-Imagine-Do-Share framework, would help cultivate what’s called the I CAN mindset, a belief that young people are not helpless, that change is possible and they can drive it.”[9]  In the first year, they sent the guide to 30,000 schools on India; then, she had the opportunity to give a TED Talk on the matter and in 2010 it went viral.[10] In 2010, Design for Change expanded worldwide, in countries such as Korea, Australia, Brazil, and Russia. In 2011, the initiative won the INDEX Design to Improve Life Award,[11] and started to get support from Education Experts such as Howard Gardner who said  “It is a simple idea, but is a constructive idea at the same time. We can’t deal with ideas [that are] too complicated, they don’t travel, and so many ideas are self-congratulatory rather than constructive. What I see is that this is wonderful constructive gift to the school, the community, the nation and now many other countries around the world.” [ citation needed ]  In 2012, Design for Change won the Rockefeller Foundation Innovation Award and expanded to have collected 800 stories in India and 4,200 worldwide.[10]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Yearly funding for Design for Change has mostly been from grants or awards from Humanitarian Foundations, including: 2011 Index Awards, Fetzer Institute ,  Rockefeller Foundation ,  The LEGO Foundation ,  Ashoka “Everyone is a change maker” ,  The Chicago Council on Global Affairs, The Commonwealth, and the Asia Society's Asia Game Changer Award.[12] Additionally, partners and collaborators include: “Anybody can jump” a CARE Foundation Initiative, National Institute of Design, Institute of Design at Stanford, IDEO, The Good Project “Ideas and tools for a good life”, World’s largest lessons, DAAN UTSAV, and Claris.[12]  With initiatives in 70+ countries and regions, Design for Change's organization structure varies among its member organizations. However, a core team of designers and educators can be found on the official website. [13]  Run by founder Kiran Bir Sethi until 2018 when Design for Change introduced its first round of board members, the CEO is now lawyer, Monica Canton De Celis Calvo; its all-female board of directors is also available on the website. [14]  An advisory board of education experts was also convened to to guide and provide advice for advancing the global I Can movement.[15]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The  Design for Change ""Feel, Imagine, Do, Share"" method  is a process of collaborative and creative thinking that enables students to find innovative solutions to problems and challenges that they face every day, either at school or within their community. The solutions can go from designing a machine to improving a social service. This process has empathy as a central concept.[2] When the students start to connect with the problem they want to address, then they begin to understand the situation, and its multiple facets.  The analytical piece of this method comes when the students and teachers engage within the four main steps of the program (Feel, Imagine, Do, Share), examining different perspectives to the problem, and testing solutions. The final goal is to come up with the best package of solutions by integrating the whole community if it is necessary. Thus, Design for Change seeks to promote analytical thinking among students, teachers, communities, and parents. The idea is for them to get a well-founded knowledge of the subject, and stay away from easy and fast solutions. Through fostering creativity, a team can collaboratively begin to design solutions (action plans), and prepare strategies for implementing them.  Major Projects and Events  Design for Change markets its methodology as a “school challenge,” open to anyone - students, communities, schools - who is interested, because Design for Change believes that every child and teenager has the capacity to become a valued and active citizen. Participants in the Design for Change method are thus completely self-selecting. The curriculum is open to children in kindergarten to eighth grade who are accompanied by an adult Design for Change member.[6]  Teachers that decide to use the DFC method receive guidance from Design for Change Worldwide (which has offices in more than 30 countries). It often happens that the method is first known by the students rather than teachers. If this is the case, the children form a group, and then look for a teacher who is willing to accompany them during the whole process of change. On the other hand, Design for Change commits to accompany the mentor (teacher) during the whole process, depending on their needs. In this sense, DFC is a two-way communication between the participants involved. They engage and build a small scale decision-making process to maximize the impact of their efforts beyond the class.  Adult mentors can be teachers, parents, youth leaders, or coaches. Entire countries that participate in Design for Change host a national social change school competition every year and give a deadline near the end of the school year in May. Team projects are evaluated and one team is selected to represent their country at the global Be the Change Conference.[16] This two-day event is an opportunity to collaborate and inspire across borders.  The application of the four step methodology is designed to enable children to think about problem solving in an empathetic way that gets them out into the community. An example of this in action can be seen through the project DCF2012 Singapore: Elderly Cleaners.[17] Students  deliberated  by brainstorming problems to tackle based on what they have observed in their communities. This team felt that elderly cleaners in their school were not respected for the hard work they do. Public participation happened early in the process when they designed a public poll and interviewed strangers in their community. Using their feedback, they developed a campaign to raise awareness about the issue which involved fundraising, a peer-quiz, public speaking, and mind-maps. Ultimately, their project was successful and they could see attitudes positively changing in their school.  “Design for Change” is marketed as a school challenge but it is not a contest. All changes made within schools and communities are valued, shared and imitated all over the world by posting the case on the website, organizing events beyond the school, and adding supporters, such as local governments and private companies. It is often the case that children see what other groups are achieving through this method, and then they want to imitate the project, as well. In the end, the first group ends up leading an initiative that grows to involve many actors within the school community, and even beyond (government, NGOs, IOs, and donors).  Natalia Allende, representative of DFC Chile, notes that their  ""aim as an organization is to challenge the children to become the catalysts of change they want to see in the world...In this context we do not choose the winners, but we have a jury that evaluates each case based on its impact, creativity, and boldness.""[ citation needed ]  Design for Change hosts an annual international meeting called “I Can,” where children and youth across any country share their experiences, celebrate the change and learn more from each other’s stories.[18] In Chile, for instance, the last event gathered the 20 most amazing stories of the country. Again, this instance serves to expose outstanding cases and spread their outcomes throughout the whole Design for Change community and beyond.  The idea behind DFC is to empower society through a methodology that allows it to generate a personal and social transformation. Their creators today are talking of “a global movement that causes a social transformation, and promotes an intersectional collaboration in order to create opportunities that drive citizens to be protagonists of their own development.” [ citation needed ]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Design for Change offers their methodology for free online and in an accessible way to the public. As a result, the method has proved to be easy to follow. More than 70 countries have adopted the program[19] and projects have been on a range of topics, most prominently in the areas of the environment, education, and health.[20] Generally, outcomes have been positive. Problems have been addressed, while students learn empathy, collaboration, communication, and leadership skills.[20] Teachers and students have enhanced their relationship and the community benefits as well. One of the most recent and innovative components of the Design for Change method is the last stage entitled as ""Share"" which Allende suggests ""helps the children to reflect about what has been achieved, and also to inspire their peers to be the change, and do not wait for others to address them.""[ citation needed ]  According to the DFC organization,  “research conducted by The GoodWork Project has reaffirmed the impact of the DFC curriculum on the development of skills like collaboration, creative thinking &amp; empathy. [Ongoing research suggests] that the confidence developed through the project improves academic scores as well."" [4]  PublicationsDoes this organization publish reports, studies, or other media?

Origins and Development  Located in California, Without My Consent was co-founded by lawyers Colette Vogele (President), a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society and an attorney at Microsoft, and Erica Johnstone (Vice President), name partner of law firm Ridder, Costa, and Johnstone LLP, in San Francisco. The organization was started in 2011  after these two lawyers sued online trolls on behalf of three clients successfully using lawsuits filed anonymously to prevent continued unwanted attention towards the victim of a privacy violation. The organization's foundation and initial work was supported by the  Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic at UC Berkeley School of Law , the  Fenwick &amp; West law firm,  Stanford's Center for Internet and Society , and financially supported by  donations from a fundraising effort . It specializes in providing information on anonymous lawsuits given they are scarcely used.  Organizational Structure and Funding  Public fundraising efforts were made in 2012 through a panel event, in San Francisco with a donation goal of 10,000 USD, and in 2016 Peerlyst teamed up to donate 10USD to the organization when each user signed up to their service during the RSA Conference.  In 2015 Without My Consent also obtained a Digital Trust Foundation grant for the 50-State Project, the Something Can Be Done! guide and a lawyer training program.  990 tax filings show total revenues of:  $ 53,164 for 2015 [1], $ 121,334 for 2016[2], and $67,912 for 2017 [3].  Specializations, Methods and ToolsAdvisors  from academia, legal and government practitioners, internet and privacy activists and experts collaborate on three large projects surrounding harassment, abuse, and exploitation online. The organization primarily focusses on public information campaigns and increasing access to legal help for those who have experienced online harassment or abuse. The organization also does it's own research and analysis of online harassment in order to collaborate on solutions.  Major Projects and Events  One of the projects is an ongoing compilation of  current US state laws . As of August 2016 it contains information for California, Florida, Kentucky, Nevada, New York, Texas, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. For each state, information on statutory civil law, common law, restraining orders, family law, statutory criminal law is posted with easy to understand interpretation of the law and grounded with legal precedents closely tied to unwilling publication of personal images and harassment. Furthermore, federal Statutory Civil Law and federal Statutory Criminal Law is provided. Case law, filing requirements and relevant statutes for all 50 US States and federal guidelines for civil and criminal proceedings filled pseudonymously are also explained  in detail .  The second project is a guide geared at informing victims and legislators about appropriate steps for  evidence protection , through their  document  Something Can Be Done! Resource Guide for Victims of Digital Abuse &amp; Harassment, published March 1, 2016. It details how to  approach and access legal advice  that protects victims through  pseudonymous lawsuits  and  copyright protection  using take-down notices and copyright registration, as well as  evidence preservation .  The third project is a victim  survey on online stalking, harassment and privacy violations from July 2013 to February 2014.  Preliminary findings  suggest the majority of respondents experienced multiple episodes of harassment from multiple harassers (46.6%), and 71% reported that their harassment influenced their use of technology (p. 12 of report). The report also details what measures victims took to try to put an end to their harassment.  Without My Consent has been profiled in the  New York Times Magazine , the  This Week in Law podcast , and  Forbes . It also had two panels at the South By Southwest Interactive conference in Austin in March 2012:  Debate: Should Social Sites Allow Anonymous Users? with Electronic Frontier Foundation's legal director Cindy Cohn, and the  Help! I Have An Internet Stalker or Blackmailer! panel.  Since Without My Consent was established,  Twitter has changed its harassment policies ,  Google decided to remove sexually explicit images shared without consent  and Microsoft's  Bing search adopted reporting mechanisms for revenge porn .

Specifically, the projects democracyCo undertake are both deliberative and ahere to the following principles:Are transparent – democracyCo design their processes to be fully open and transparent about all elements of the process design and delivery as possible. democracyCo only work with people and teams who agree to operate in a transparent way.  Are collaborative – democracyCo know that policy making will be better and more sustainable if it’s done collaboratively, meaningfully involving citizens, key stakeholders and government agencies – and supporting them to work together.  Model respect – citizens are smart. Collective groups of citizens are as able, if not more able, to develop good policy responses to complex issues as anybody else; when they have the information and time required to consider problems, weigh up options and propose solutions.  Ppromote independence – participants need to be allowed to seek their own information / advice and come to their own conclusions without coercion or undue influence. This is the only way that their work will be trusted.  Have meaning – giving citizens’ the ability to have influence means committing at the start of a process to implementing some or all of what they decide. democracyCo require this for every project they undertake.  Are citizen centred – democracyCo design all of their processes for everyday citizens. They are accessible, enjoyable and also 'stretching' – as they know that when designed for citizens, deliberative processes will deliver what they need to. democracyCo also want people to enjoy this way of working, so they will demand more of it is done.democracyCo have built a reputation for their commitment to the above principles, meaning their work is often complex, balancing many competing interests. However, according to Emily and Emma, it is their adherence to these principles that drives their love of public engagement and deliberation.  Origins and Development  democracyCo was born out of a frustration that governments’ were not achieving quality reform that was able to address the scale and complexity of the problems faced by our communities.  Their experiences in recent years have also revealed that communities are not trusting of decisions made by governments, nor by the way in which they are made. democracyCo recognise that this is not unique to Australia, and have watched with concern how thriving democracies around the world have become susceptible to this trend.  This encouraged democracyCo to create a business which is unique in every way. democracyCo is owned by Emily Jenke and Emma Fletcher and operates as a commercial entity. democracyCo deliberately does not align themselves with issues, nor do they promote agendas. Instead they work with any government, of any persuasion who wants to reform alongside their citizens. As a duo, Emily and Emma use their combined skills in deliberative techniques, policy making and group facilitation to bring governments and the communities they serve closer together.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  DemocracyCo is headed up by co-founders Emily Jenke, and Emma Fletcher. Emma has extensive experience working in and with government and led the  Better Together policy in South Australia , which spearheaded meaningful, embedded engagement with communities in government decision-making in SA. The initiative has received praise worldwide and been recognised in international awards.  Emily Jenke has almost 20 years experience as a facilitator and practitioner in engagement. She also has extensive experience working with government and has worked with the SA government on previous engagement initiatives. Emily was also instrumental in the  Reforming Democracy policy  in South Australia and delivers the governments  Better Together suite of training programs.  democracyCo are a for profit business trading as a company and do not accept donations.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  DemocracyCo provides reform services to Governments to bring about enduring change and improvement in citizens' lives.  DemocracyCo are specialists in developing deliberative strategies to approach reform. This is informed by the recognition that there is no point in having a deliberative process if in reality, the decision has already been made. They do not advocate a single methodology but use a variety of techniques suiting the circumstances. They follow a co-creation process with clients and stakeholder to design strategies and processes together.  Democracy Co facilitate deliberative processes from start to finish - all over Australia and internationally. They have extensive expertise in facilitation and managing group dynamics.  Major Projects and EventsPeople's Policy    democracyCo are the creators of the  Peoples' Policy  method - which aims to put citizens at the very centre of the policy making process.

Still Moon actively encourages and facilitates participation, interaction, and engagement around issues of environmental sustainability, artistic and cultural heritage, and community wellbeing. Their vision is ""a Still Creek neighbourhood where people live as part of a healthy ecosystem and participate in a community where the arts thrive.""[1]  Origins and Development  The Still Moon Arts Society was established by Terry Taylor in 2004. The Society’s founding corresponded with the increased urbanization around and degradation of  Still Creek  in the Renfrew Ravine and the beginning action-phase of the 2002 “Still Creek Rehabilitation and Enhancement Study” commissioned by the City of Vancouver. The Society was instrumental in securing community members a seat at the table during in the formulation and implementation of an  ecosystem-based management  model of the Creek through the Integrated Stormwater Management Plan beginning in 2007.[3]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Still Moon Arts Society is overseen by a nine-member Board of Directors headed by President Crecien Bencio and Vice-President Henry Lau.[4] Its work is supported by team of individuals including Artistic Director, Carmen Rose, General Manager, Bea Miller, a nine-person Youth Committee, and an eight-person Communications Committee.[5] Most of their activities are open to the public but certain events — such as monthly meetings of the Streamkeepers — require registration and recruitment efforts generally targeted at community members and residents of the Renfrew-Collingwood neighbourhood.  The Society is a registered non-profit, funded through donations, grants, and public/private partnerships.[6] As well, the Society also offers a number of services priced from $300-$400 including group tours of Renfrew Ravine, Lantern Workshops, Community-Engaged Art Talks, and stilt performers.[7]  Specializations, Methods and ToolsParticipatory ArtsStill Moon Arts Society specializes in the use of  participatory arts  to connect community members to each other and to the land. Through artistic experiences and expression, the Society imparts a passion for nature and communal living.[1] Their yearly Renfrew Ravine Moon Festival features a diverse array of participatory arts.[8]Ecosystem Based Management and StewardshipThe Society and its group of Still Creek Streamkeepers have been involved in the planning, restoration, and ongoing community governance of Still Creek in the Renfrew Ravine through an  ecosystem-based model of management . The Streamkeepers host public educational sessions on stream stewardship and their work includes the following activities:Water quality testing  Ravine cleaning  Garbage removal  Invertebrate sampling  Removing invasive species and replanting with native plants[2]Major Projects and EventsRestoration of Still Creek   As an official partner in the establishment of an ecosystem-based management model of stream governance over  Still Creek , the Still Moon Arts Society was tasked with “co-ordinat[ing] activities, provid[ing] leadership, and ensur[ing] liaison between all collaborators [as well as] connect[ing] people to resources in the community through EBM [ecosystem-based management] implementation.”[3] Since 2007, the Society and its group of Still Creek Streamkeepers continue to monitor the health of the creek and to organize events and activities to improve the water quality, sustain ecosystems, and rehabilitate the newly returned salmon.[2]Renfrew Ravine Moon FestivalA yearly event, the Renfrew Ravine Moon Festival is a celebration of creativity, community, and nature. Featuring local artists and various spectator and  hands-on activities , the Festival invites participants to celebrate the harvest season, learn more about community-members’ cultural traditions, and build an appreciation for the interconnected nature of local ecosystems and species.[8]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  In her Master’s Thesis for Simon Fraser University’s School of Resource and Environmental Management, Catherine Parsons found that local governments and community organizations such as the Still Moon Arts Society deserve equal recognition and credit in  the restoration of the Renfrew Ravine . In partnership with  the Evergreen Foundation , the Still Moon Arts Society was found to have been effective in raising awareness, mobilizing support, and organizing community-led efforts to restore the Still Creek Watershed.[11] Parsons concludes that the Society was instrumental in “establishing collaborations between people and organizations in the watershed… coordinat[ing] ecological restoration activities with the high school to educate students and foster[ing] environmental stewardship in youth.""[12]  Publications  Still Moon Arts Society is not directly involved in the production of research publications but they do circulate a semi-monthly, community-focused newsletter.[9] The resource section of their website also provides educational and background information on the Still Creek and Renfrew Ravine Restoration process such as the City of Vancouver’s Rain City Strategy and a local plant guide.[10]  See AlsoThe Collaborative Restoration of Vancouver's Still Creek  (case)Participatory Arts  (method)Ecosystem-based Management  (method)The Evergreen Foundation  (organization)  References  [1] Still Moon Arts, ""About,""  Still Moon Arts Society , October 13, 2012, http://stillmoon.org/about/.Update:  https://stillmoonarts.ca/our-story/[2] Still Moon Arts, “Still Creek Streamkeepers,”  Still Moon Arts Society , July 23, 2018,  https://stillmoonarts.ca/stewardship/streamkeepers/[3] Catherine Ernestina Maria Parsons, “Restoring a ‘Paradise of a Place’: Exploring the potential for urban Ecosystem-based Management in the Still Creek Watershed, Vancouver, BC,”  Simon Fraser University , June 26, 2015,  http://summit.sfu.ca/item/15649[4] Still Moon Arts, ""Board of Directors,""  Still Moon Arts Society ,  https://stillmoonarts.ca/our-story/our-team/[5] Still Moon Arts, ""Our Team,""  Still Moon Arts Society , Jan 15, 2016,  https://stillmoonarts.ca/our-story/our-team/[6] Still Moon Arts, ""Funders and Supporters,""  Still Moon Arts Society , October 9, 2012, http://stillmoon.org/about/funders-and-supporters/.

By improving the interconnections and interdependencies between people, nature, and the built world, Evergreen aims to help cities thrive in a sustainable manner. According to the group’s vision, “involving people directly in the process of restoring the health of local ecologies and their communities positively affects the attitudes and behaviours that lie at the core of the sustainable city” (About Evergreen).  Origins and Development  The Evergreen Foundation is a Canadian charity and international thought leader established in 1991. For over 25 years, Evergreen has been working in collaboration with diverse communities using a systems approach which recognizes people, places and environmental issues as “part of interdependent, complex social and economic systems” (About Evergreen). In total, over 200,000 volunteers have devoted more than 600,000 hours to Evergreen’s programs, greening public spaces and leading various projects in their communities. Their goal to turn innovative ideas into actionable projects is sought through a mix of engagement strategies, which aim to be playful and optimistic yet empowering and designed to initiate change. Throughout their history, Evergreen has and continues to be dedicated to the principle of accountability, ensuring that the delivery of programs is up to the standard of the communities and that those who put in time and effort are rewarded in kind.By the numbers:600,000 hours put in by over 200,000 volunteers  Over 1 million children in 25% of Canadian schools reached through the Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds and 70,000 kids enrolled in Evergreen Brick Works outdoor learning  Over 500 community recipients of Evergreen grants and partnerships  1,511,692 trees, shrubs, and other greenery planted, and close to 4 million square metres naturalized across Canada  Almost $5 million invested in the local food economy and 686,542 pounds of food harvested from community gardens (Our Impact)Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingFunding for EvergreenEvergreen has numerous public and private sponsors and supporters, a full list of which is available  here .  National Partner: Toyota Canada Inc. and its Dealerships have worked with the foundation for over 12 years, distributed more than $2.8 million in grants to over 2,350 schools and day cares with an estimated impact on over 1 million students and close to 100,000 school faculty members.  Lead Partner: the  Government of Ontario  with its various ministries has partnered with Evergreen since the foundation’s inception. Together, this collaborative effort has made possible the realization of Evergreen’s goals: to “bring greenspace to cities across the province; find and share solutions to urban infrastructure and transportation challenges; and provide children, seniors, and families education about sustainable local food systems” (Sponsors and Supporters).  Other major contributors: Walmart Canada (Evergreen’s “Green Grants”), HSBC Bank Canada (Evergreen’s Greenspace program), and the J.W. McConnell Family Foundation (Evergreen’s Canadian Civic Commons Strategy – in progress).Funding Provided by EvergreenFrom 2000-2015, Evergreen and Walmart offered the “Green Grants” which supported over 600 school greening projects. The “Toyota Evergreen Learning Grounds” program gives resources to “help schools create outdoor classrooms to provide students with a healthy place to play, learn and develop a genuine respect for nature” (Grants). Since the grant was first offered in 2000, over 3000 schools across Canada have received funds to help engage their students in outdoors activities, build respect for nature, and learn about their surroundings while having fun.The RBC–Evergreen Watershed Champions Award has been given annually since 2014 and “recognizes classes that demonstrate learning about their local watershed and who take action to care for it” (RBC). Participants in the contest gain recognition for their work in sustainable management and development as well as community engagement activities that help to spread awareness about the necessity for ongoing watershed protection.Specializations, Methods and Tools  Evergreen has four areas of focus: Greenspace, Children, Food, and CityWorks.  1. Greenspace  Greenspace is Evergreen’s chiefly environmental program helping to connect the people with the ecosystems they live in. The program encompasses four areas: community greening, partner projects with municipalities and communities, restoring urban watersheds, and enhancing Toronto’s Lower Don Valley (see “Major Projects” section).i. Community GreeningCommunity greening events take place all over the Greater Toronto Area, Metro Vancouver, and Vancouver Island, providing individuals, families, and friends the opportunity to volunteer their time to increase the sustainability and restore the natural beauty of their neighbourhoods. Working in public parks and natural areas, community greening volunteers engage in various activities such as “planting trees, monitoring wildlife and removing invasive plant species.” The organization sees that its volunteers“Meet like-minded people in [their] community  Make a positive impact on the environment  Learn about the benefits of planting native trees and shrubs  Learn how to identify invasive species and how to remove them  Plant trees for future generations to enjoy  Have fun!” (Community Greening).Currently, there are multiple greening projects in the works.ii. Municipal and Community PartnershipsGreenspace’s work wouldn’t be possible without the strong ties Evergreen has developed with local municipalities, communities and community organizations, and other land managers. Through these partnerships, Greenspace has been given access to unique natural spaces and support in raising awareness and getting more individuals involved in the reinvigoration of their environments. Through these support networks, Evergreen’s initiatives are producing long-term, sustainable impacts.iii. Restoring Urban WatershedsWatersheds are defined as “area[s] of land where all of the water that is under it or on the surface of it goes to the same place” (Restoring Urban Watersheds). Urban watersheds in the Metro Vancouver Area and the Greater Toronto Area face degradation from civil infrastructure projects such as roads and buildings. As well,  stormwater  — the runoff from urban areas — flows downstream into these bodies of water, carrying with it various toxins and contaminants. Part of Evergreen’s Greenspace endeavour focuses on the restoration of these watersheds as well as increasing urban biodiversity and measuring the impact of urban development on urban streams.  To accomplish these goals, Evergreen and its community and municipal partners “remove invasive plants, reintroduce native plants, monitor water quality and learn about the importance of our local streams” (Ibid.). For example, the organization’s work on biodiversity is helped by the Invasive Species Council of Metro Vancouver and Ontario’s Invasive Species Awareness Program which, in use with Evergreen’s Native Plant Database, can help community members identify and remove or replace invasive and damaging plant species. As well, Evergreen’s “Uncover Your Creeks” program on the coast of BC has sixteen different monitoring sites which are used by volunteers and community members to track the quality of water. The data from this project helps Evergreen understand the impacts of urban development on these streams, to develop interventions and, ultimately, to mitigate the harmful aspects of this process (See “Major Projects” section of this article for further information).  Finally, the urban watersheds program is focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation, defined as “actions taken to respond to the impacts of climate change by taking advantage of opportunities or reducing the associated risks” (Restoring Urban Watersheds). The Metro Vancouver Area and the Greater Toronto Area are both expected to feel the effects of climate change in terms of increasingly severe and frequent rainfall — both of which “can mean damage to infrastructure and public property, and health impacts due to wastewater contamination in water bodies” (Ibid.). Since there are a variety of ways communities and individuals can get involved in climate change adaptation, Evergreen, with support from the Intact Foundation, “is connecting residents with opportunities for climate adaption in their watersheds through the Community Climate Adaptation Initiative” more information about which can be found by click here. As well, on a municipal level, Evergreen recently supported the Vancouver Parks Board’s Master Plan for the  restoration of Still Creek  (see “Major Projects and Events” section of this article for a more in-depth account).  2. Children  As the world moves more online, children are spending more time indoors, less time exercising, and developing a sense of community with their peers. Evergreen is determined to change this worrying trend by offering young Canadians a variety of ways to engage with the natural world, “to learn and to engage their senses, to explore and to discover their surroundings, and to challenge their minds and bodies” (Children). Four areas make up this ambitious initiative: the greening of school grounds, programs for learning and playing outdoors, leadership opportunities, and year-round day camps.i. Greening School GroundsEvergreen’s work on school grounds involves balancing the natural with the built world, creating an environment that meets the functional needs of the classroom while offering kids “different looks, sensory experiences and play opportunities in every season” (Greening School Grounds). Evergreen brings the influence of naturally occurring features into the planning and design process which creates diverse landscapes for children to explore and discover.  Evergreen takes a one-on-one approach to their school greening initiatives, working closely with each school board to draw up the optimal design for their location, resource allotment, goals and needs. Currently, the organization works with 13 school boards and districts as well as the Nova Scotia Department of Education and Early Development but encourages any interested citizen or school to become involved through the national network of Evergreen planning experts who provide assistance with:“Approvals processes – creating clear lines of communication and accountability within the school board  Guidance through a participatory design process – resulting in coordination between the school board, school administrators, facilities staff, external suppliers, parents and the broader community  Planning support for project installations – preventing costly mistakes in school-ground modifications and creating high-quality, safe and lasting project designs  Design guidelines – providing clarity for all project stakeholders and creating significant efficiencies  Education and training – supporting schools in the use of and care for their new spaces, and providing the motivation for engaging students in both.” (School Board Collaborations &amp; Services)In addition to offering expert collaboration, Evergreen offers a number of grant opportunities to schools (see “Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding"").ii. Outdoor Learning and PlayingLearning through hands-on experience is vital to childhood education and, thankfully, the natural world provides plenty of opportunity to do so. Evergreen is dedicated to ensuring kids have the ability to explore and discover their environment by offering school and home-based activity ideas to educators, parents and guardians through  workshops , school programming, and publications.  The Watershed Champions program is an example of the kinds of outdoor learning initiatives Evergreen encourages schools to offer their students. Schools compete for the “RBC–Evergreen Watershed Champions Award” by learning about, caring for, and spreading awareness around their local watersheds. More information on the award is found in the “Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding” section.  Another example of Evergreen’s work in this area is the “All Hands in the Dirt Forum”: an annual meeting of education, administration and design experts to discuss best practices and new innovations in the area of outdoor learning. Past forums have included workshops, activities, and small-group discussions on topics such as:“Addressing questions of risky play in the outdoors  Increasing and improving learning opportunities in children’s outdoor spaces  Unpacking policies and practices for children’s outdoor spaces  Designing for child development and increased physical activity  Evaluation and assessment for teaching outdoors” (All Hands in the Dirt Forum).iii. Youth LeadershipThe Evergreen Foundation believes that “a key component is having the opportunity to develop skills and gain experience in nature while becoming the stewards of the environment we’ll need for tomorrow” (Youth Leadership). Together with community organizations, Evergreen offers a number of youth leadership programs which emphasize hands-on learning and teamwork. The Community Bicycle Hub Project is a great example of the social-enterprising abilities youth can gain through these activities. After learning to fix donated bikes, participants return to their communities and pass on their acquired skills. Similarly, youth involved in the Healthy Choices program work together to “make healthy food choices for themselves, their communities and the planet” (Ibid.). Community and teamwork are also key aspects of the Aboriginal Visiting High Schools project, a collaborative effort between Evergreen and schools groups to facilitate the transfer of traditional knowledge between elders, members of the Aboriginal community, and youth.  Alongside these programs is the yearly HSBC-Evergreen Youth Action Series, a week-long series of events “exploring ecology, green living, stewardship and green infrastructure all while offering youth the opportunity to network with others who are stewards of the environment” (HSBC–Evergreen Youth Action Series). In 2016, the event was to be held in five different cities in Canada: Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.Finally, Evergreen holds leadership training programs for its summer camps (discussed below). Leaders-in Training and Assistant Counsellors are each offered two week training programs that serve as valuable volunteer hours for school.iv. Day CampsEvergreen is proud to offer different day camp experiences at their Brick Works facility in Toronto: Nature Nut Kids' Club, Sprouts Parent and Tot Play, PA Day Camps, Homeschool Program, March Break Day Camp, Green City Adventure Camp, and Winter Camps. Each day camp is focused on giving children the ability to experience and explore the natural, ‘greener’ side of Toronto through outdoor play. Designed to educate the next generation of inspired environmental stewards, each program is planned according to the following principles:“Place Based – building a foundation of knowledge through a focus on local nature, culture and community.  Ecological – providing children direct contact with nature.  Hands-on – creating a setting for compelling learning through multi-sensory, direct experiences.  Active and mobile – moving the body to engage the mind.  Arts-infused – breathing life into learning through creativity, compelling narratives and arts activities.  Integrated – weaving together knowledge and skill through ecological themes and engaging experiences.” (Evergreen Brick Works Day Camps).More information on the each of the different day camps can be found  here .3. Food  Evergreen’s approach to food is simple: good food = happy people and healthy cities. By supporting local farms, encouraging the growth of food in cities, and working to improve the eating and living habits of everyday citizens, Evergreen aims to make a change in the way we sustain ourselves.i. Supporting Local FarmsGlobalization has caused a fundamental disconnect between consumers and the producers of their food. Evergreen believes that re-establishing this connection is key to creating a sustainable food system, “preserv[ing] the health of our cities, the integrity of our environment and the strength of our communities” (Supporting Local Farms). To initiate this, Evergreen has committed itself to the following guiding principles:“Accessibility: A farmers' market and food programs that are accessible to diverse audiences.  Collaborative Infrastructure: Build relationships with other like-minded organizations and community groups, as well as the community at large.  Innovation: Foster and celebrate innovation at our farmers' market and in the design and delivery of our food programs.  Education: Create an experiential, hands-on approach to the delivery of our food programs.  Replicability: Establish models that can be replicated locally and nationally.” (Ibid.)In order to accomplish these goals, Evergreen encourages its partners, volunteers, community members, and interested citizens to:Shop at the Farmer’s Market located in Evergreen’s own Brick Works facility in Toronto  Engage in Evergreen’s Community Supported Agriculture program (more information here)  Visit the Farmer’s Markets Canada website to find local producers outside the Toronto areaii. Growing Food in the CityCreating a sustainable food network starts at the community level, whether it is sourcing food directly from local producers or growing one's own. The Evergreen foundation offers two programs designed to make the food growing process easy even for the apartment-bound city dweller.  For those living in Toronto, the Urban Agriculture program at the Evergreen Brick Works showcases new innovations in do-it-yourself food production. The easily replicable food gardens offer everything from organic vegetables to edible flowers while the greenhouse “features raised-bed food gardening, various organic agricultural techniques and window farms to showcase a “full circle” approach to seasonal food-growing in urban areas” (Growing Food). Similarly, grow tubes demonstrate how nutritious food can be grown in cold climates using very little light. Evergreen’s dedicated compost-experts volunteer their time as ‘worm wranglers’, imparting the wisdom of “at-home composting, the benefits of waste management and the importance of healthy soil to all visitors at Evergreen Brick Works” (Ibid.). Finally, both the Seniors Garden and the Cooking Classrooms offer visitors the opportunity to engage hands-on in the food growing (and eating!) process.iii. Healthy Eating and Active LivingCities and communities are only as healthy as their citizens so Evergreen has made it its mission to encourage individuals across the country to develop healthy eating and active lifestyles. Workshops and educational events make it easy for anyone— big eaters or small—to learn how to create hassle-free, healthy meals using local ingredients. Seniors Community Kitchen at the Brick Works brings seniors and youth together with Evergreen staff to “share skills and knowledge, socialize and prepare seasonal, nutritious meals together” (Healthy Eating &amp; Active Living). As well, Evergreen experts work with Community Kitchens in the Greater Toronto Area to discuss everything from fundraising strategies and buying on a budget to food justice and increasing the kitchen’s food gardening capabilities. Check the calendar for events happening across the country  here .The Healthy Choices initiative is Evergreen’s way of engaging directly with communities “to share meals, celebrate food and build life-long skills, and invite a wide range of groups to connect with our passionate and expert staff” (Healthy Eating &amp; Active Living). As well, the Healthy Choices initiative also offers youth-specific programs (see “Children” section of this article).  4. City Works  City design and civil infrastructure planning have profound effects on the way inhabitants live and interact as well as the natural environment they displace or overlap. Evergreen’s City Works initiative engages the public, innovators, designers and decision makers to reduce the large-scale environmental impact of our cities – from city-building to housing to transportation, Evergreen “believe[s] that transformative change can happen when Canadians are engaged with new ideas, in ways that are relevant to them” (City Works).i. City BuildingSustainable development is complicated by accelerated urbanization and aging infrastructure. Evergreen’s City Building initiative brings leading research and design to its collaborative work with city planners and communities to help develop a clear vision for the future. It is Evergreen’s hope that this vision combined with local, national, and global action will mitigate the risks our human and environmental health face by building cities with smaller carbon footprints and more sustainable infrastructure.  Evergreen’s City Building department has just finished two projects—100in1day Canada and Project Green Bloc in Vancouver—and is involved in two other ongoing initiatives: the Hamilton City Building Action Campaign and “We Are Cities”. Information on all these projects is available in the “Major Projects and Events” section.ii. HousingGlobal rises in urbanization demand a rethinking of housing infrastructure. By 2036, the population of the Greater Toronto Area is expected to increase by more than 9 million and it is therefore imperative that an integrated approach to housing is generated, “one that is more sustainable, affordable and equitable” (Housing). Evergreen believes that through the building of “collaborative capacity and co-created solutions”, a green future for Toronto’s housing systems may be developed.  By testing these ideas on a local scale, Evergreen hopes to deploy proven sustainable housing strategies across Canada where appropriate. The GTA Housing Action Lab is the real-life testing ground for these new innovations. The Toronto area is facing many of the same urban housing problems faced by other cities across the nation and, indeed, across the globe. Specifically, some of these challenges include lack of affordability especially for lower income households; environmental degradation from automotive travel; lack of social housing and affordable repair options; and a growing disparity between “development patterns and regional growth and transportation planning. The GTA Housing Action Lab aims to collaboratively develop:“Programs and policies that support the affordability of housing to ensure residents of all incomes have the best chance to live in a suitable home and have a choice in their housing  A more sustainable housing system in the region by increasing public support for intensification, awareness of the benefits of complete communities, and policies that support creative infill in our urban centres and a connected region  A policy and regulatory framework that encourages diversity in form and tenure, intensification and affordability, and creates incentives aligned with the needs of the residents of the region while creating an economically viable housing sector” (GTA Housing Action Lab)Another project Evergreen’s City Works is involved in is “Tower Renewal”, more information about which can be found in the “Major Projects and Events” section.iii. TransportationTransporting people and goods across the country accounts for 27% of Canada’s emissions. The ability to move sustainably is under pressure from increasingly dense, sprawling urban populations. Evergreen’s work on transportation recognizes the need for creativity and vision to come up with new forms of travel and, therefore, its projects such as “Move the GTHA” and the “TrafficJam Hackathon” focus on engaging Canadians in discussion and debate on this important topic. More information on these projects is available in the following section, “Major Projects and Events”.  Major Projects and EventsUncover Your CreeksOne of the Evergreen Foundation’s major projects is the “Uncover Your Creeks” initiative which helps monitor urban streams in Metro Vancouver and the Greater Toronto Area. Recently, the Evergreen Foundation was involved in the restoration Master Plan of Vancouver’s Still Creek. Evergreen took a leading role, engaging with local governments and members of the public and undertaking rehabilitation activities such as riparian planting (Tyler Carlson). As well, the ongoing data collection and monitoring of the stream was made possible through a partnership with the Community-University Research Alliance (CURA) H2O project. CURA H20 works with various government and community partners in Canada and abroad to “build capacity within stewardship organizations through a variety of resources and training, and to address the lack of consistency by standardizing data collection at the community level via the Wet-Pro training program” (About CURA H20). In this case, CURA H2O and Evergreen are helping the community monitor the health of its stream and take measures when needed without the need for government intervention. A full case study of the Still Creek project is available  here .Lower Don ProjectThe Don River Valley is located in the heart of Toronto’s East York district and is currently home to 250k residents with an expected increase of 80k in the coming years. The Lower Don Greenway is accessible through 5km of trails yet few residents are aware of the diverse natural ecosystem located right in their backyard. Public green spaces “create livable communities and promote personal, social, cultural and environmental health” and it is therefore Evergreen’s mission to revitalize the Lower Don trail. Working in collaboration with partners such as the  City of Toronto  and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, Evergreen has planned a variety of improvements to “allow residents and visitors to better enjoy and appreciate the wonders of this remarkable ravine corridor” (Lower Don Project):New gateways and access points  Pedestrian and cycling trail enhancements  Restored green spaces  New public art and educational programsFor more information on the project, please see “External Links”.100in1day Canada100in1day is a global movement started in 2012 by a group of design students in Colombia. What began as an albeit ambitious plan to launch 100 urban interventions in one day produced a world-wide phenomenon. The original event in May of 2012 returned an unanticipated 250 interventions and since then 100in1day has been held in 31 cities around the world. Evergreen is proud to have led 100in1day Canada which occurred on June 4, 2016 in six cities: Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, Hamilton, Montreal, and Halifax, and initiated 580 citizen-developed building ideas. More information on each of the projects can be found in the ""External Links"".Project Green Bloc in VancouverProject Green Bloc was started as a three-year project with the ambitious aim to “fill the gap between individual level and city-level change and forge a strong bloc of neighbours, willing to take action individually and collectively to mitigate climate change and unsustainable levels of consumption out of a random group of residents who just happened to live on the same city block” (Project Green Bloc). To accomplish this, Evergreen worked with the residents of Vancouver’s Riley Park neighbourhood to lessen the community’s ecological footprint by 25% through local action and behavioural change. Four main components made up the project:Research to measure household and neighbourhood ecological footprints  Carefully structured community consultation and dialogue  Cooperative local greening and sustainability initiatives  Activities to build community cohesion and social inclusionBy the end of the three years, the neighbourhood had collectively reduced their ecological footprint by 12% but legacy projects such street greening and traffic calming ensure a long-term dedication to their sustainable living goals.The Hamilton City Building Action CampaignHamilton is experiencing a period of urban revitalization and cultural renaissance and, in order to both accelerate and sustain this, Evergreen CityWorks is collaborating with their partners, Planning Alliance, the Hamilton Communication Foundation, and the City of Hamilton to initiate the multi-year Hamilton City Building Action Campaign. The campaign consists of five elements focused on “work[ing] with the community in shaping the city’s future, connect[ing] plans and policies while also catalyzing on-the-ground results” (Hamilton City Building Action Campaign).  1. Outreach, Engagement, and Collaboration – bringing a diverse selection of residents and stakeholders into the discussion  2. Priority Scanning and Mapping the City – meetings with various players in the community revealed an overwhelming  consensus  that focus should be placed on “tangible actions and specific urban interventions” (Hamilton City Building Action Campaign).  3. West Harbour Engagement Strategy – discussing the future of the West Harbour neighbourhood with its residents, local community groups and organizations, stakeholders, and Lura Consulting. These discussions will in turn be used to inform future communication strategies between city officials and community residents.  4. Next Generation City Builders – Imagine My Sustainable Hamilton (IMSH) – a four-day program intended to bring ecological awareness and sustainable city-building to seventh grade classrooms in over 15 schools. As well, students are constructing 3D models of their visions for their future neighbourhoods with the help of the art collective No. 9 in collaboration with the Hamilton Wentworth District School Board (HWDSB) and local architects and artists.  5. Community Capacity Building and Action100in1Day Hamilton (see previous section of this article)  Training and Capacity Building Workshops  Community Driven Catalyst Projects294 James Street North A Collaboration Station and Community Hub for Engagement“We Are Cities”We Are Cities is an ongoing initiative launched in February 2015 to address the need for liveable cities across Canada. The project is  crowdsourcing  ideas from Canadians for an action plan as well as helping to support current initiatives. To date, “there have been over 50  roundtables  in 25 cities across 10 provinces, over 175 ideas have been submitted online” and the foundation has created the new “We Are Cities: Community Innovation Grant” to help progress local projects (We Are Cities).Tower RenewalThe Tower Renewal project began in 2007 in response to the deterioration of Ontario’s Greater Golden Horseshoe concrete apartment blocks. Situated in marginalized neighbourhoods with few amenities and limited access to transport, the 2,000 aging, energy inefficient towers represent 20% of Toronto’s housing stock and are home to nearly 1 million people. Recognizing the need for intervention, Graeme Stewart and Michael McClelland of ERA Architects initiated the renewal project which, thanks to the Centre for Urban Growth and Renewal and the City of Toronto, encompasses three processes:“An energy retrofit of existing buildings  Improved livability for renters and their surrounding communities through increased social and economic opportunities within tower neighbourhoods  Better use of the green space around these towers through mixed-use infill development and improved transit connections to and from these neighbourhoods” (Tower Renewal).Through these efforts, it is hoped that the towers are transformed from “isolated and often socially marginalized dormitories into dynamic, integrated and low-carbon hubs across the city” (Tower Renewal).Move the GTHABack in 2011, a number of community organizations were brought together by Evergreen CityWorks and the Toronto Atmospheric fund to discuss the possibility of forming a collaboration. By working together, it was hoped that these organizations would be able to raise public awareness and increase support for transit infrastructure. Subsequently, “Move the GTHA” was born in September 2012 and now has 12 core members and 16 supporting organi",1,0,1,1,0,,"The Evergreen Foundation is Canadian non profit dedicated to ecological research, design and collaborative initiatives.

 The KWI strives to offer North Rhine-Westphalia's cities and regions with a place to share and discuss the results of ambitious cultural research. [1]  As part of a three-university netowrk, it supports cooperative, interdisciplinary research in the humanities, social and cultural sciences and collaboratives with regional, national and international partners. The KWI also promotes civic education through its outreach programmes, public events, co-operations with cultural institutions and media partners. [2]  
 Origins and Development 
 The Institute was founded in 1989 by the North Rhine-Westphalian Minister President Johannes Rau. Rau was succeeded as director on April 1, 2018 by the literary scholar Julika Griem. [3]  
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 As an interuniversity college of the Ruhr University Bochum, the Technical University of Dortmund and the University of Duisburg-Essen, the institute works with the universities' scientists and other partners in the North Rhine-Westphalia and abroad. [4]Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 As part of the University Alliance Ruhr (UAR) and its multi-layered institutional structure, KWI invites open discussions of contemporary working conditions and their social consequences. A special role is given to young colleagues, for whom the KWI is available as a meeting place and discourse arena. 
 With its recent change in leadership, the KWI re-organized its research into four new fields: 
 i. Cultural science research: the role of language, symbols, images and media in the self-description and organization of science 
 ii. Cultural and literary sociology: how convincingly combined methods and theories can be used to obtain data and insights with which philological and sociological questions can be linked. 
 iii. Science communication: analysis of contemporary mediation problems in the face of the challenge of populist skepticism about science. 
 iv. Teaching laboratory: develops new humanities and cultural studies formats and types of events, which can also be further modified at other universities as prototypes for research-oriented teaching. [5]As well, various research areas have been successfully established at KWI including, among others, participatory culture and communication culture. [6]Major Projects and Events 
 The Institute has led several participatory research studies in the Ruhr region. Projects like  Demoenergy  ,  EnerTransRuhr,Energy Transition North Rhine-Westphalia , the  Ruhr Region's Energy Transition Framework  , and  Essen's Climate Initiative  have successfully brought citizens into the design and implementation of Germany's transition to clean energy. KWI is also a project partner on Participedia, sharing insights into its work on Germany's participatory culture. [7]Analysis and Lessons Learned Want to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Like their counterparts in the USA, Canada and other places in the world, OccupyGhana also seeks to give a voice to the majority of people in Ghana.  Origins and Development  This group was started by a group of middle class professionals, notably lawyers, teachers, doctors, students, researchers, bankers, journalists, etc who hitherto had remained silent on the many happenings in government before and after the Fourth Republican Constitution came into being in January 1993.  The organization began as a loose online community using the hashtag  #occupyflagstaffhouse  and moderated by a few volunteers calling themselves “The Concerned Ghanaians for Responsible Governance,” (CCGRG). It soon became apparent that the Twitter hashtag discussions revolved around the same goals: ending government corruption, addressing infrastructure decay and intervening in Ghana’s worsening economy. Consequently, the transition from online discussion to on-the-ground action came on July 1st, Republic Day. Approximately five hundred people turned up to occupy Flag Staff House, the office and residence of President John Dramani Mahama. The initial group of organizers – still using the name Concerned Ghanaians for Responsible Governance – delivered a  petition  to the government asking for immediate action on numerous social ills.[1]  The #occupyflagstaffhouse protest served as a catalyst for the creation of the OccupyGhana organization. Originally its members sought to distance themselves from the rest of Ghanaian society, perhaps in the belief that only middle class, educated professionals would evoke a reaction from the government. This approach not only failed but it also undermined the legitimacy of the protest – whose asks were not unreasonable – since the Constitution guarantees equal representation and denies the privileging of certain voices. A new  protest  – #RedFriday – was launched just ten days after the first and called for all Ghanaians, regardless of social standing or profession, to again turn to  social media  to spread their message and to wear the colour red in solidarity with the campaign.[2] According to Al Jazeera, this second attempt was the true turning point in the creation of OccupyGhana as a standing organization. Included in #RedFriday were “countless individuals and diverse groups - ranging from faith-based organisations, academia, farmer-based associations, non-governmental organisations, women groups, students and political parties.”[3] Accordingly, the OccupyGhana membership now covers a wide range of people from all spectrums of society.[4]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  As presented on their website, OccupyGhana is run by an executive team consisting of nine professional individuals consisting of a lawyer, a chartered accountant, a researcher, a journalist, a civil/structural engineer, a digital marketing strategist, a marketer, a IT consultant and an investment banker. While information is not provided in regards to these individuals relations to the government, given that it is an anti-corruption organization, presumably it is unaffiliated with the Ghanaian government. This executive team carries out the background coordination for protests and  online deliberation  activities.  The organization is open to anyone; signing up to be a member does not cost any money. Through their website Occupygh.org, signing up requires only a name and an email address. Likewise, the organization uses both Facebook and Twitter to alert citizens to local political and social issues. ‘Liking’ or ‘following’ the organization on these platforms allow people to both demonstrate their solidarity with the movement and to sign up for alerts to new postings.  While specific funders are not provided on the organization website, perhaps for political reasons, there is a ""donation"" tab on the web which may have helped start-up costs as well as continual operational costs of the organization.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  OccupyGhana is a citizen-watchdog group dedicated to informing the public about government activities. The organization is also known to transform its online support into on-the-ground action in the form of non-violent  protest ,  demonstration ,  picketing  and  occupation .Online , members and non-members interact using Facebook and Twitter platforms. Facebook serves as a hub where members share information (videos, pictures and articles) and perspectives to increase awareness and strengthen solidarity. Much of the organization's action is done through the umbrella name of the organization, the personal names of individuals participating in action is not provided. Initiatives on behalf of the organization are backed by extensive research to validate claims. While the organization does have a formal sign-up forum on its website, supporters of the organization also mobilize action through  social media  with campaigns to articulate the group's message. The subsequent offline action generally takes the form of organized protests in the form of picketing, demonstrations and occupation. As well, as seen in the #RedFriday Campaign, simple acts of solidarity are encouraged such as wearing the colour red or locally-made dresses.[5]  Major Projects and Events  After the original #occupyflagstaffhouse and #RedFriday protests, OccupyGhana coalesced into an official organization that has dedicated itself to its aims of spreading awareness and, bringing an end to the government’s inefficiency and general ineptitude.  A timeline of its major initiatives is as follows (government/public reactions in parentheses):  October 2014Public demonstration against the continuation of poor economic governance 100 days after #occupyflagstaffhouse (no reaction)  Protest against Ghana’s hosting of the African Cup of Nation football tournament due to the risk of Ebola (successful)[6]November 2014: Bringing awareness to Auditor-General flaws[7]After a public inquiry into the Auditor-General, OccupyGhana found evidence for his mismanagement of public funds (no reaction – campaign continues)  Demand for member of parliament Nelson Abudu-Baani to step down after calling for “adulterous women” to be stoned (eventually apologized for his comments)  Took an official position against government official’s cash hand outs to journalists in exchange for favourable media coverage (some journalists stopped covering OccupyGhana’s activities in protest)February 2015Organization wrote to the National Communications Authority asking for information on the new ‘interconnect clearing house’ through which all internet connection will be re-routed[8] (NCA failed to respond)[9]  Issuing of a Statement in Support Of “Wɔn’ Gbo”, meaning “We Are Dying”, a protest led by the oppositional New Patriotic Party demanding an end to “dumsor”, a colloquial term for the continuous electrical power outages[10] (President issued a press statement promising to ‘do more’)[11]October 2015[12]Support for DUMSORMUSTSTOP vigil led by Ghanaian actress Yvonne Nelson (blackouts continue)[13]  Official rejection of government proposed 9% increase in Fuel Prices (no response)  Condemnation of the assassination of Mahama Adams, opposition Upper-West ChairmenMay 2016Revelation of backroom deal between the government and Smarttys where the latter was contracted – using public funds – to cover its public buses with images of the president (no response)[14]  OccupyGhana filed a Supreme Court action against the Attorney-General to enforce the Auditor-General’s governmental obligation[15]Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

The Danish Board of Technology Foundation also serves to provide Denmark with a solid basis with which to address technology issues involving other nations.  Origins and Development  Like all of today’s governmental bodies, the Danish Parliament often needs to make decisions about various uses of technology. These decisions can have a significant effect on public interests, from traffic, energy and agriculture to education, research and health. In order to help ensure that technology decisions are made wisely, the Parliament established the Danish Board of Technology (Teknologi-rådet) in 1986. The DBT changed its name to the Danish Board of Technology Foundation in 2012.  A few examples of the topics addressed by Foundation projects within the past five years are Copenhagen’s underground railway system, genetically modified foods, electronic self-service in the public sector and technological changes in elementary and junior high-level school.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Board of Technology Foundation is comprised of a Board of Governors, a Board of Representatives and a secretariat of about 12 staff members. The Minister for Research is the supervising authority for the Board and the Parliament’s Research Committee is the Board’s liaison to Parliament.  The Board of Governors consists of the Chairperson of the DBT and ten additional members. The Board of Governors, which meets seven times a year, selects the projects which will be pursued, oversees the budget, and appoints the Director of the DBT.  The Minister for Research appoints the Chair of the Board of Governors and three of the members. The other members are appointed by the Minister on recommendation from the following organizations: The Industry and Trade Development Council, the Salaried Employees’ and Civil Servants’ Confederation, the Danish Confederation of Trade Unions, the Danish Employers’ Confederation, a joint representative of the National Association of Local Authorities and the Danish Association of County Councils, the Danish Council for Adult Education and the Danish Research Councils.  The Board of Representatives has up to 50 members and serves as a forum for open debate on topical issues related to technology assessment. The Minister for Research appoints up to ten representatives following a discussion with the Board of Governors. The other representatives are appointed based on recommendations from the above organizations, as well as many other Danish organizations.  The Board of Representatives has two meetings per year, one of which is earmarked for discussing the DBT’s work plans for the coming year’s projects. The other meeting is dedicated to discussion and evaluation of the work that has been completed throughout the year. Although they do not have decision-making power, members of the Board of Representatives serve as important resource persons for the DBT, generating ideas for new projects and providing valuable feedback on current projects.  The DBT identifies different target groups for involvement in and education about each of their projects. The Foundation targets people and organizations that are able to make decisions and take action on the technology issues at hand. The Danish Parliament, other government entities, the experts and the companies that develop the technologies are made aware of the Board’s assessments. Nonprofit organizations and social activists are also considered to be pivotal in any kind of change effort. And as citizens and consumers, the general public can influence developments and thus act as an important target group. If an area of technology is international by nature, foreign communities can also be target groups for the Board’s activities.  Although it is not directed by the Danish government, the DBT is funded by the government. The Foundation receives an annual subsidy of approximately 13 million Danish Kroner ($1.7 million). One third of the Board’s annual budget is designated for management and administrative expenses, one third for technology assessment (both expert and citizen technology assessment); and one third for public education.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Danish Board of Technology Foundation (DBT) initiates projects based on their economic, democratic or environmental importance to a large number of people. A project’s topic may already be of interest to citizens and politicians, or there may be a clear need to increase awareness on the topic. The topics must have technological content, and are usually controversial topics that tend to cause conflict and make decision-making difficult. Special emphasis is placed on clarifying the interaction between technology, society and people.  The Foundation strives to ensure that technology in Denmark is in harmony with the desire for a democratic, fair and economically, ecologically and socially sustainable society. Depending on the project, this can translate into a need to utilize a familiar technique more effectively, a need to curb the misuse of new techniques and new technology, or a need to cultivate future advancements.  Building on the strong democratic traditions of Denmark, the Foundation helps to inform and generate debate and discussion on as broad a basis as possible. It makes use of expert knowledge as well as the insight, experience and credibility of non-expert citizens in its evaluation of technology. And it initiates relevant and important technology debates among various sectors of the public as well as among decision makers.  Although the DBT's technology assessments do not always conclude in recommendations for a solution, technology assessments often identify joint views, conflicts and options as the first step toward finding a solution. The Foundation must therefore create a foundation for clarifying views, visions and a debate on technology issues. To create this foundation, the DBT may seek expert analyses on technology issues, involve citizens directly in the technology assessment process, take steps to educate the general public on a particular issue, or do any combination of the three.  To ensure that both the need for factual, reliable information and the need for meaningful public participation are met, the DBT makes use of a variety of specific methods for evaluating technology. The Foundation has developed some of these methods itself, while others have been borrowed from international and other Danish institutions.  One of the most well known methods is the  consensus conference . These four-day events provide an opportunity for a small but representative group of citizens to engage in extensive dialogue with experts on a particular technological issue, to  deliberate  amongst themselves about possible action steps, and to then present consensus-based recommendations to the government and to the press. The Foundation has sponsored approximately 20 consensus conferences on such topics as electronic identity cards, genetically modified food, educational technology and the future of private automobiles, and their methods for using this model have been duplicated in many other countries.  Other methods are also used by the DBT to involve ordinary citizens, special interest groups, politicians and experts in the assessment of technology.  Scenario workshops , future search conferences, policy exercises, work groups, opinion polls and questionnaires are a few examples. The Foundation typically organizes one or two consensus conferences each year, one workshop a year, and multiple local citizen hearings about various topics.  The Foundation has also convened an alliance of public and private entities who developed the  World Wide Views methodology  for large-scale, multi-site public consultations on a single topic.It has been implemented on the multinational level on topics such as  climate and energy ,  global warming , and  biodiversity .  Major Projects and Events  Each year, the Danish Board of Technology Foundation (DBT) works on a number of different projects that assess technology and improve the public’s knowledge about the selected issues. The DBT calls upon members of Parliament, various organizations, businesses, and citizens annually for topic ideas for the coming year’s efforts.  The Board of Governors selects 20 possible projects from well over 100 suggestions. Staff members of the DBT then research the 20 issues to determine what work is already being done around the topic and to determine whether the Board of Technology’s methods would help. The staff synthesize their findings into 20 concise two-page reports, which are presented to the Board of Governors.  After the Board of Governors selects the six or seven projects that will become a part of the following year’s work plan, the staff members develop a detailed plan for each project which includes extensive background information, the concept and purpose of the project, the methods which would be most effective in addressing this issue, the groups which would be targeted for involvement, the ways in which information would be disseminated, the kind of impact that is anticipated, and a timetable and budget for the project. These project descriptions then go to the Board of Governors for approval.  Projects are organized under broad categories such as  information technology , culture/media, agriculture, environment/energy, health care, traffic and technology policy. The six projects selected for 2002 – from 172 total topic suggestions – cover such important and varied topics as genetically modified food and the third world; hydrogen in a renewable energy system; and making the cities great places to live.  A brief description of one of 2002’s projects, “How are we going to assign value to the environment?” is as follows:  ""How can we determine the price of environmental benefits and pollution so that these factors come to form part of an economic analysis in an acceptable way? The question of how we assign value to the environment has really become a topic of current interest, especially in the wake of the Ministry of Finance’s report on environmental policy’s benefits and costs. Recently, we have seen this in the cost-benefit analysis of particle-emissions from heavy vehicles. There are, however, serious methodological problems with how we can determine the monetary value of the environment.""  In addition to its various projects, the DBT serves as an advisor to the Danish Parliament and other government entities in a number of ways. The Foundation responds to specific questions that members of Parliament have about technology issues. It organizes hearings for parliamentary committees which bring in experts as resources on the particular issue being examined. The DBT sometimes approaches members of Parliament in relation to topical technology issues. And the Board of Governors submits statements to Parliament which summarize the results of a project.  Analysis and Lessons LearnedInfluence, Outcomes, and EffectsOnce a year, the Foundation submits a report to the Parliament which summarizes findings from the various projects. Reports are also prepared for each of the projects, and these are often used by academics and students. All of the reports are made available to the public on the Danish Board of Technology Foundation website, and the media helps to get the word out about the projects’ results.  Depending on what it wants to achieve and who it wants to reach with the information, the Foundation uses a variety of avenues to disseminate its work. The press is an important channel for conveying the DBT’s results. The Foundation’s target groups often include people who may not have the time to study all of the literature they receive, but who will follow developments in the newspapers, on the radio and on TV newscasts. Many people’s perception of whether there is an ongoing debate in a particular area is closely linked to the treatment of that topic in the media. The press is therefore an important tool in setting the agenda for public debate.  After a project is completed, the Foundation may decide that the topic needs and deserves further development so that it can be adapted for community meetings and other forums. To promote public education at the local level, the DBT provides financial support for local educational events, educational materials featuring facts and views from all sides of the debate, and lists of resources such as speakers, literature and films on the topic.  It is difficult to assess the Danish Board of Technology Foundation’s impact on specific technological issues. Since its aim is primarily to foster and inform debate and discussion about technology among both decision makers and citizens, a look at some of their activities illustrates that the Foundation is meeting this goal.  The Foundation has held hearings for members of the Danish Parliament on Copenhagen’s underground railway system. The have produced a report on the benefits and challenges of 100% organically-certified agriculture. They have organized a role play for  stakeholder groups  on choices and possibilities for energy consumption. They have led  workshops  and distributed brochures on possible technological advancements in elementary and junior high schools. And they have organized a consensus conference on the production and consumption of genetically modified foods. These are only a few examples of the Board’s numerous activities that have informed debate about technology issues.  Some of the Foundation’s activities have led to concrete political action. One consensus conference uncovered citizens’ strong position that blood tests should never be required for job applicants. The subject was then discussed in Parliament and, partly due to the consensus conference, blood tests were banned as requirements for employment in 1992.Strengths of the Organization's WorkAlthough technology has and will have an intense effect on people’s lives, most technology decisions are made outside of Parliament. Many important decisions are made by manufacturers of technology, and many more are made by citizens – the consumers of technology. The Danish Board of Technology Foundation does not focus solely on informing and influencing the Danish Parliament, but also informs and involves citizens, businesses, manufacturers, academics and others.  The DBT selects its projects very carefully, making sure that the topic is not only important, timely, contentious and relevant to policy, but also that it would not be better served by a different method of assessment. This careful selection, although time-consuming, increases the likelihood that the projects the Foundation administers will be successful and influential.  The DBT is well-respected by members of the Parliament, Danish educators and others who are familiar with the Foundation's work, and even internationally. Within the Danish Parliament, the Foundation enjoys a fair degree of multi-partisan support, although liberals are more supportive of their work than are conservatives.  When experts are requested to make assessments in order to provide an overview of the issue, the Foundation utilizes the best available expertise, often drawing experts in across professions and sectors, ensuring that many elements and different values are represented in the assessments. Interdisciplinary working groups of experts are sometimes established, and experts who disagree on the topic at hand are often brought in, ensuring that the results will not be biased.  Through its leadership in the consensus conference model of public engagement and decision-making, the Danish Board of Technology Foundation has helped answer one of today’s most difficult democratic problems: How can ordinary citizens make intelligent decisions about complicated and ever-changing technological issues? By providing a demographically (not politically) representative group of citizens with high-quality information and facilitation – and then feeding the results of that microcosmic dialogue back into the macrocosm of public discourse – democratic society is given appropriate wisdom to reflect and act upon.Challenges &amp; LimitationsThe Danish Board of Technology Foundation’s work often does not make an impact in Parliament. Although the DBT tries to set up meetings with the relevant committees in Parliament and always sends the reports, having members of Parliament attend such meetings and listen openly to the information that is presented is not common. The Foundation does, however, use other means to influence Parliament indirectly, such as having their findings reported on in the media, and informing citizens of the issues.  Another challenge that the DBT faces is that, although it is funded by Parliament, it is run independently of government influence and has to continually remind members of Parliament that it exists, and that it is available as a resource to them. The fact that the Danish Parliament does not usually initiate studies and projects adds to the difficulty. The DBT, however, has been successful since 1995 in taking on the role of arranging public hearings for the Parliament. With one or two months’ notice, the Foundation can organize a half-day or day-long public hearing which brings in a variety of experts on the issue and is open and publicized to the public. Members of Parliament are becoming more and more accustomed to utilizing this option.  Working within a reasonable and pre-determined time frame for its projects causes some challenges for the Foundation as well. Although the Foundation tries to judge the projects partly on timeliness, its reports often seem to be too early or too late to make an impact in Parliament. A report may be submitted years before the issue is considered in Parliament, or it may be submitted just a few months after a decision has been made.  Another limitation that the DBT currently faces is politicians’ lack of faith in and reluctance to rely on the ability of public participation methods to produce good decisions. A recent European study which examined the extent to which consensus conferences influence the legislative decisions of the Danish Parliament revealed that although 75% of the members of Parliament were familiar with consensus conferences, and about half of these had actually attended one, only 13% of those familiar with the model felt that the conferences sometimes led to parliamentary discussions, debates or initiatives, such as the issuance of laws or guidelines. According to the results of this study, the Foundation is facing a body which may not be receptive to one of its most innovative methods.PublicationsThe DBT also produces a range of publications focused on the goal of stimulating and informing discussion on technology issues. These publications are sent out to target groups, and they can be ordered from the Foundation. The DBT’s magazine, which is published six times annually, contains news stories, background information, articles and debates, all primarily related to the Foundation’s current projects. The Board’s newsletter, which is sent to members of Parliament, features short descriptions of current technology issues and problems as well as summaries of the Board’s work. The Foundation also publishes a variety of reports, books and pamphlets, and disseminates information internationally on technology assessments and methods for conducting technology assessments.  All DBT publications are available on its  website .

FCAB recommendations and advice provided the DOE with an understanding of the issues and concerns that were important to local stakeholders and ensured that these perspectives were incorporated into planning and decision making on the Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP) site.  The Department of Energy facility in Fernald, Ohio, was used to produce high-purity uranium metal for nuclear weapons from 1951 to 1989. During this period, over one million pounds of uranium were released into the surrounding environment.  In the late 1980s, the local public became aware of contamination caused by the site in the local groundwater, and in the soil and buildings at the site. Fernald was actually one of the first sites to become known nationally for acknowledged federal environmental mismanagement, and the problem was featured in 60 Minutes and as a cover story in Time Magazine. DOE was required to pay damages to local residents and to the state of Ohio and agreed to allow the state to oversee its waste disposal activities.  Conclusions and demands of local citizen groups, the US and Ohio EPA and the DOE managers at Fernald, all of whom were concerned about reducing the human health risk and environmental damage in the area, led to the creation of the Fernald Citizens Advisory Board (FCAB) in 1993. FCAB was established in order to provide policy and technical advice regarding important clean-up decisions to the regulated and regulating agencies. In 1995 it was deemed that over 3 million cubic yards of waste and contaminated material would need to be removed from the site.  The Board was to not only include the easily identifiable affected parties, but also individual residents who live in the vicinity of the site. It was to be small in size, involving less than 20 people, to have a clear mission, to include governmental officials as nonvoting members, to reflect the variety of views in the surrounding community and to attempt to reach consensus. Administrative and technical support was to be provided by the government.  FCAB was active until September 2006, at which point the clean-up was completed.  History  The United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) produced nuclear weapons for the US Cold War effort. To this end it also managed 21 facilities in 13 states, together named the Nuclear Weapons Complex. In 1951, the AEC began construction of a uranium production facility 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, Ohio. Titled the Feed Materials Production Center, it was situated on 1050 acres and was situated near the community of Fernald. It employed 2800 individuals and produced most of the uranium used in US Nuclear Weapons production.  Controversy struck the site when, in 1984, a faulty dust collector at one of the plants released nearly 300 pounds of enriched uranium oxide into the environment. It was also revealed at that time that uranium had contaminated three off-site wells just three years earlier. Since the community sits above the Great Miami Aquiver, one of the largest drinking water aquifers in the country, these revelations caused great concern and anger. The community filed a class action lawsuit against the Department of Energy (DOE, previously known as the AEC) and five years later received compensation of $73 million.  Nevertheless, in 1989, the Environmental Protection Agency added Fernald to a list of the country’s worst waste sites. After much public campaigning, particularly by the Fernald Residents for Environmental Safety and Health (FRESH), the DOE in 1991 decided to change its mission regarding the Fernald site entirely to environmental remediation. The main contractor, Westinghouse, hired to manage the Fernald site, was replaced by the Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Company (FERMCO, which later became Fluor Fernald) in order to focus management completely on the clean-up and closure of the site.  While the DOE communicated with the local community according to the minimum regulatory requirements, the residents were eager to have a much greater involvement in the project. In response to their repeated calls for involvement, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established a forum called the Federal Facilities Environmental Restoration Dialogue Committee (FFERDC), which would provide a blueprint for all stakeholders to bring about creative solutions to the problems facing federal facilities. DOE managers at the Fernald site decided to implement this mechanism. This led to the establishment of the Fernald Citizens Task Force in 1993, which then changed its name to the Fernald Citizens Advisory Board in 1997. It met over a 13-year period in order to provide recommendations for the better management of the remediation process.  Organizational Structure and and Funding  The originating and funding organisation is the U.S. Department of Energy. Its general mission is to meet and manage the United States’ energy and environmental needs. It was established in 1977 to consolidate the federal government’s activities in the energy sector and facilitate the establishment of a national energy plan. Prior to the DOE, activities relating to atomic energy had been managed by the Atomic Energy Commission. The entire clean-up project is estimated to have cost $4.4 billion.Participant SelectionA maximum of 15 members served on the FCAB. These included labor representatives, local government officials, representatives from a local environmental activist group, academia and local business representatives, along with a number of non-voting members from DOE, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Ohio EPA, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Members came from neighboring communities, local governments, trade unions and area universities.  The first members were appointed by the DOE Assistant Secretary for Environmental Restoration and Waste Management. Subsequent new members were appointed by the Manager of the Ohio Field Office. Members were chosen from a list prepared by a committee of the Advisory Board which contained the details of citizens who had shown interest in the position. To ensure continuity of membership, half of the initial board members agreed to serve two-year terms and the other half agreed to three-year terms, although approximately 75% of the original members still served on the Board nearly 10 years after first being established. FCAB members received no compensation for their time, but travel expenses were reimbursed.  FCAB sought to maintain a diverse membership with perspectives that spanned the broad range of individuals and groups who were affected by the remediation and future use of the Fernald site. In order to protect against bias, an outside convener was hired to interview, screen and select the participants.  Specializations and Activities  Full board meetings and sub-committee meetings were held monthly, typically lasting approximately four hours and two hours, respectively. Recommendations and comments of the Advisory Board were made by consensus, while during votes for formal recommendations 3/5ths of the votes were required to make a decision official. Central items, such as budget and remediation progress, were evaluated by the full board, while committees with three to five members worked on more long-term and in-depth projects. FCAB tackled topics and issues that were important to the local community and relevant to constructive citizen input.  Guided by a Chair and Vice Chair from within the membership of the group, FCAB also received facilitation support from an independent and neutral consultant. The consultant served as the facilitator during all FCAB meetings and sub-committee meetings. A staff member of the Fernald DOE Public Affairs Department devoted a substantial portion of her time to FCAB as well.  Four public affairs staff members at the Department of Energy’s Ohio office simultaneously served as “counselors” who bridged the gap between the public and specific DOE projects (water, soils, etc.). These counselors prepared for FCAB meetings and other public participation events by anticipating what questions the public may have had and obtaining answers at staff meetings and other venues.  FCAB members recognized that their small group, however diverse, could not represent every viewpoint of the public. In order to obtain broader input from the public about some of the more controversial issues and to demonstrate their own independence from the Department of Energy, FCAB conducted its own public outreach efforts. The Board held various well-publicized meetings, workshops and presentations to increase public understanding and involvement in the remediation.  Major Projects and Events  Initially, FCAB was charged with the task of providing the DOE, the U.S. EPA and the Ohio EPA with recommendations regarding four primary questions: What should be the future of the Fernald site? What residual risk and remediation levels should remain following remediation? Where should the waste be disposed? What should be the priorities among remedial actions?  The Department of Energy estimated that FCAB’s subsequent recommendations saved the taxpayers more than $2 billion over the lifetime of the project. This substantial savings is partly due to FCAB’s call for the acceleration of cleanup efforts (to be completed by 2006 instead of the DOE’s original 2020 goal). The amended cleanup estimate of $2.9 billion – $4.3 billion less than the original $7.2 billion estimate – resulted from years of savings in building maintenance expenses, salaries for workers and a number of other expenses. FCAB also saved a significant amount by recommending that 80% of the FEMP site’s waste remain on-site, and that off-site disposal be limited to 20% of the waste. Since it would have cost three times more to ship the waste than to construct the on-site disposal facility, an additional $700 million was saved.  However, after these issues were addressed in 1995 through a report, the FCAB continued to operate as an important citizen voice in the continued restoration efforts. The FCAB’s recommendations had a strong influence on policy decisions, mainly because of the high regard public officials had for their process. Managers at the Department of Energy in Fernald developed respect for the group and their work after reviewing the 1995 report. Many of the managers were surprised by the depth to which the group studied the issues involved, and the sound analysis of information and practical fact-based recommendations generated the managers’ respect toward the members of FCAB.Outcomes and EffectsThe biggest achievements of the FCAB over 13 years include:Making high quality decisions that improved effectiveness of clean-up, saved time and money, and reduced the risks to the community and workers  Taking a balanced approach to clean-up, such that, future uses of the site would be restricted, but the amount of soil needing removal was reduced  Appealing to the Secretary of Energy for quicker removal of special nuclear materials so that clean-up was not delayed and costs saved  Appealing to the DOE for a redesign to the clean-up system so that aquifer clean-up could proceed with less uranium contamination  Convincing the DOE to use trains to transport contaminated materials instead of trucks, thereby reducing transportation risks and saving costs and time  Recommending the creation of a Critical Analysis Team, whose activities ended up improving project efficiencies, reducing risk, and preventing costly delays  Bringing concerns about powdery waste in a silo to the DOE’s attention, which led to it being contained with a sticky liquid such that it could not become airborne  Urging the DOE to seek offsite storage for waste in aging silos at a facility in Texas  Championing issues that might otherwise have been ignored, for example the repatriation of Native American remains at the site, planning for long-term stewardship and public use of the site, and public access to information after closure of the project  Facilitating good working relationships between stakeholders, which included the public, the DOE, contractors, and federal and state regulators  Facilitating public awareness and education of stakeholders on technical issues as well as the particular interests held by different actors involved. This allowed decision-makers to integrate the various interests into effective policy  Establishing an effective decision-making process that became a model for Advisory Boards at other DOE environmental management sites in the countryOn average, between three and eight recommendations were made by FCAB each year. The recommendations they provided began broadly (the site should be available for public recreational use), and then focused on particular suggestions (the network of trails should be of this type, and in these locations; records should be housed in this type of facility), and always included detailed information about how conclusions were made.  Analysis and Criticism  Since the same small group of individuals met face-to-face over a long period of time, FCAB facilitated the exchange of information and viewpoints and the in-depth understanding of the topic at hand. Trust was built among the participants and, even if the group was unable to reach consensus on a particular issue, areas of disagreement were narrowed, conflicting parties recognized others’ concerns as legitimate, new alternatives and ideas emerged and, at the very least, the issues on the table became more clear to all parties.  FCAB was able to tackle contentious issues that involved stakeholders with conflicting values and needs. Since FCAB worked at the local level, its members had a significant stake in the issues the board addressed and were accountable for its results. The board contributed to a better-informed public, more sustainable solutions to complicated problems, improved relationships among stakeholders and between government officials and citizens, and increased public buy-in for government decisions and programs.  One senior DOE official told the Presidential/Congressional Commission on Risk Assessment and Risk Management: “The Department [of Energy] has learned the power of having the public involved in decision-making. For example, the Citizens Advisory Board at Fernald has dramatically changed the department’s cleanup strategy at that Ohio site. The results will be a far more expeditious cleanup, with a savings of some $2 billion compared with the cost of the department’s original plans. By opening the process to meaningful public input, the department is empowered to make decisions it could never make unilaterally.”  There were challenges and limitations, too, however. A surprisingly high number of the original participants still served on the FCAB towards the end of the project. A tightly-knit, highly informed and active group could intimidate potential new members, preventing the Board from evolving and ensuring that qualified people had the opportunity to serve on the Board.  FCAB went through an awkward, uncertain stage after it completed its initial report in 1995 but decided to continue meeting. It was some time (18 to 24 months) before the DOE realized that FCAB needed to have a specific task to focus on in order to be effective. One alternative which would have addressed this and the previous problem would have been to establish new FCABs – with new memberships – each time the Fernald facility or state DOE needed to obtain informed public input on a complex issue.  Running FCAB was time consuming and resource intensive. It required genuine support from the convening agency, including financial support, information, guidance, time and expertise.  FCAB’s recommendations were taken seriously by managers at the Fernald DOE. FCAB had a strong influence on policy decisions, but this influence was not guaranteed. The public officials involved with the Fernald facility developed a great deal of respect for the FCAB members and their recommendations. Working closely with senior management at DOE, convincing them that citizen participation was important and worthwhile and that it was worth their time and effort to go beyond what was required of management was very important for FCAB’s success.  Overall, after 13 years of operation, four valuable lessons were learned that would be useful for similar projects in the future: 1) Create a clear focus for the Advisory Board. This means having a well-reasoned work plan, making decisions with a solid understanding of the context in which the decision is being made, and understanding the relationships to other organisations such that an efficient division of labor can be established. 2) Create a strong administrative structure. This largely involves ensuring a clear group structure and understanding of the ground rules, using the committees to address big issues, assessing the strengths and drawbacks of membership terms, and evaluating work achieved on a regular basis in order to improve for the coming period. 3) Use a consensus-based decision making process. The successes of FCAB were significantly due to the manner in which decisions were approached. These were often based on good information gained through group learning and information sharing. Collaboration among stakeholders and outside facilitation were also frequently made use of. Importantly, a good sense of humor and efforts to enjoy the time spent together allowed for group cohesion. 4) Create effective outreach and communications. While the FCAB maintained a strong relationship with the community, local governments were regrettably not engaged with as often. Another weakness found was that, despite a strong working relationship at the start, FCAB were not able to maintain effective ties with DOE Headquarters towards the end of the project. This is believed to have diminished the influence of the Advisory Board at that time.Secondary Sources  Interviews conducted by Sandy Heierbacher with Sue Walpole, the FEMP site’s Technical Liaison to the FCAB, Gary Stegner, Deputy Designated Federal Official, and John Applegate, former FCAB Chair.

The mission is to bring together post-secondary students with local practitioners to work on experimental art and media projects aimed at engaging the public in local social and political issues.  Drawing on methdologies associated with  social innovation labs , the Creative Publics Lab conducts 'civic experiments' in collaboration with post-secondary instititutions.  Origins and Development  Creative Publics Lab (CPL) grew out of the PhD research of Tara Mahoney, a student in the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University (SFU) and the creative director of local non-profit,  Gen Why Media . Gen Why Media uses art, media and public events to engage young people in social and political issues. Creative Publics Lab builds on the work of Gen Why Media and brings it together with SFU School of Communication, which has a long history of supporting and facilitating grassroots political engagement through projects such as the Media Democracy Project. The idea for the Creative Publics Lab arose out of a need expressed by students within the School of Communication at Simon Fraser University for tangible opportunities to use their communication knowledge and capabilities to promote social justice and political engagement.  The International Centre of Art for Social Change played a key role in the founding of the lab by providing support for the first experiment in the Fall of 2015 which set the groundwork for subsequent projects. The CPL has since worked with several community groups, art collectives and social enterprises including the  Tin Can Studio , Woodshop Worker’s Cooperative,  Apathy is Boring , and Woodward’s Community Singers who have helped shape the direction of the CRL through their feedback and participation. Through research and iteration, the student participants have also provided key input into the development of the lab.  Over the past decade, social innovation labs or ‘social labs’ have grown in global popularity across post-secondary institutions, government and social sector organizations as a way to invent, adopt or adapt new ideas through interdisciplinary collaboration.[1] Creative Publics Lab is an effort to stimulate and test new ideas for how student can better engage with local political issues through their course work. By teaching students how to use communication theories, methods, and practices to intervene in local issues, the CPL aims to go beyond raising students’ awareness and show them how art and media can be used to intervene and take action in strategic and creative ways. While Creative Publics Lab is the first lab at SFU focused on participatory politics, there are other efforts within SFU to use the social lab model as a way to engage students in the areas of local economic development (LED Lab), urban planning (City Studio) and environmental sustainability (Change Lab). Rationale for the Creative Publics Lab emerged from the research of PhD student Tara Mahoney and her analysis of emerging forms of participatory politics. Despite spending more time in postsecondary institutions than any generation before and being the most educated generation of all time,[2] students leave post-secondary programs without learning basic skills for applied political communication. This is the case despite younger generations facing a political environment of mounting debt, diminished job security, increasing costs of food, tuition and housing, and a convergence of challenges caused by the threats of climate change and intensifying income inequality. In the face of these collective challenges, digital civic literacy, community organizing, and political communication competencies have never been more important as is the need to support new forms civic engagement.  Since the late 1980s, engagement with traditional political institutions in Canada has seen drastic declines across the population and particularly among young people. Many commentators have chronicled this widespread civic disengagement, whether measured through participation in community affairs, political party membership, voter turnout, trust in institutions or people, the quality of public discourse, or attention to or knowledge of public affairs.[3][4][5][6] As a result of the erosion of democratic institutions, the increasing decline in the support for establishment politics and a growing sense of powerlessness among citizens, political engagement is in a process of transformation. ‘Being political’ has expanded to include a vast range of ‘participatory’ socio-political behavior associated with digital forms of political expression and organizing.  As younger generations are retreating from established political institutions and processes, new forms of political engagement are emerging that work largely outside formal political institutions and manifest as practices of self-organization, networked communication, ‘do-it-ourselves’ maker culture, and short-term conditional affiliation. “Participatory politics” is an overarching concept that encompasses these emerging currents of political engagement and is defined as “interactive, peer-based acts through which individuals and groups seek to exert both voice and influence on issues of public concern”.[7] The contemporary usage of term is rooted in theories of participatory culture [8] that emphasize contemporary and historic efforts by grassroots communities to exert greater control over the means of media production and circulation, including amateur publishing movements in the nineteenth century, the grassroots radio movement of the early twentieth century, and various forms of underground press and radio efforts in the 1960s.[9]  Nowadays political participation not only describes voting in elections, writing a letter to the editor, going to  town hall discussions , or becoming a member of a political party. Instead, activities such as making a video, sharing media, starting an organization, signing a  petition , circulating news, building an app, joining a political group online,  crowd-sourcing  policy, and organizing a community event are increasingly how publics are exerting political agency. Expressions of participatory politics can be seen in the growth and influence of ""netroots"" political associations [10] and networked social movements [11], both of which have gained prominence in the past decade and play an increasing role in citizen participation. Participatory politics can also be observed in the economic sphere, where there are substantial efforts to ‘democratize the economy’ through peer-to-peer infrastructures that are gradually becoming the general conditions of work, economy, and society.[12] The common theme joining these efforts are the deployment novel tactical repertoires and organizational strategies that utilize the affordances of the new media environment.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The International Centre of Art for Social Change provided support for the first experiment of the lab in the Fall of 2015 which set the groundwork for subsequent projects. The CPL has since worked with several community groups, art collectives, and social enterprises, including the Tin Can Studio, Woodshop Worker’s Cooperative,  Apathy is Boring , and Woodward’s Community Singers who have helped shape the direction of the CRL through their participation. Through research and iteration, the student participants have also provided key input into the development of the lab. Seed funding for the first two experiments of the Creative Publics Lab were paid for through student engagement and research grants within Simon Fraser University. The organizers designed the engagement methods iteratively, in response to course themes, student consultation, and the needs of the community partners.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Creative Publics Labs is a  social innovation lab  specializing in civic experiments: small-scale projects that use cultural and media production to test how theoretical ideas can be applied in the real world. Interventions are designed to open up new areas of inquiry and find new ways to engage the public issues of common concern.  Each of the lab civic experiments is designed to achieve the following objectives:Capacity Building: Facilitate  civic literacy  and professional development of post-secondary students through collaborative relationships with community organizations. Through  community-based learning models , the lab connects students with the social sector in order to build capacities in project management, digital storytelling, public art interventions, issue framing, event planning, media relations, and  citizen journalism .Community Engagement : Re-imagine the student course work as a way to practice dialogue,  community organizing , and cultural production through working on local political and social campaigns.  Research: Provide a space for research into the connection between the theories of civic media and the practice media-based community organizing.The Lab's experiments use a wide variety of participatory methods and tools including but not limited to:Public Policy CollagePop-up DemocracyPhotovoiceMicro-UtopiasParticipatory artsCitizen journalismActivities within the Lab:Within the lab, participation is iterative and looks different depending on the nature of project or activity. For example, in the case of the  public policy collage  experiment, participation involved people making collages, singing, and drawing in a public space. In the case of the  photovoice  experiment, participation looked like students interviewing and photographing local community organizers, writing compelling short stories, and mounting a public art display in the lobby of the university showcasing the profiles. In the case of planning micro-utopias, it looked like students using art-based facilitation technique to imagine alternative societal futures.Post-experiment Participation and Action:The lab experiments culminate in some type of public action, which can take the form of an event, appearance in the media, an exhibit, an intervention in public space, and so on. This allows for the work of the participants to be showcased in a public forum, diversifying the kinds of voices present in public discourse. For instance, in the case of the public policy collage, the collages and drawings were displayed in prominent public spaces in the weeks leading up to the federal election and the project was covered by several local and regional media outlets.  While the experiments conducted within CPL have yet to directly address decision-makers, they have sought to operate as a model for how creativity and art-making can be used to engage publics in politics. The participatory arts approach of the CPL creates the conditions for dialogue amongst diverse publics through art-based activities rather than verbal discourse. This approach makes it accessible to a diverse community who did not need to have extensive knowledge of politics in order to participate. It has allowed for listening through quiet one-on-one conversations about issues that mattered to the participants and were being expressed through the art. The act of physically making art also acts as a social lubricant, allowing people to focus on working with their hands which takes some of the intimidation out of talking about politics with a stranger.Civic Experimentation and Participatory Research:Civic experiments are a form of  participatory research  in that they attempt to solve a problem — creating effective forms of participatory innovation — through engagement with affected parties. There are three types of participants in the Creative Publics Lab: students, community partners, and the public. The students are recruited in the same way they are recruited for courses — through university communication and standard course-selection procedures. The lab focuses on students because educated people in their 20s and 30s are often early adopters of new forms of  communication technology , which put them in a unique position to take advantage of participatory politics. Community partners are recruited based on the degree to which they address key issues that have been identified as priorities for the lab. Ideally, the Lab's partners are organizations that are both innovating in the area of participatory politics and need help with engaging citizens, mobilizing public opinion, and influencing decision-making. The public is recruited through online and face-to-face projects designed and executed by the students in collaboration with community partners.  Experimenting with a variety of methods and tools has positive outcomes for participants (capacity building), and provides qualitative and quantitative data on the efficacy of the techniques for researchers and practitioners. Field notes, interviews, and written reflections from participants provide evidence that activities have created meaningful opportunities for experiential political learning and community dialogue. For instance, the interview and survey data from an experiment using public policy collage demonstrated that the method increased the motivation of participants to vote in the election, positively interrupted the patterns of everyday life, and created a political space where participants could quietly reflect on their complex feelings around election issues.  In another lab experiment using the photovoice method, pre and post  survey  results with students indicated that the community engagement aspect of their projects enhanced students’ ability to communicate about social issues in a real world setting and helped them to see how the course subject matter can be used in everyday life. The majority of students who participated also expressed how the project helped them become more aware of the needs in their community and the interactions with the community partner enhanced their learning in the course.  Major Projects and EventsArt-making and the federal election (Fall 2014)This experiment was conducted outside a course and was part of a research initiative which brought together artists, students and community members to participate in art-making inspired by social and political issues leading up to the federal election in October 2015. In collaboration with mobile art studio Tin Can Studio, CPL traveled to four sites and set up interventions where participants had the opportunity to explore election issues through various forms of art-making including collage, photography, videography, chalk art and improvised choir.Participatory Youth Media Cultures Course (Fall 2016)This lab experiment was conducted in conjunction with Communications 427: Participatory Youth Media Cultures, an advanced lecture/seminar examining the development of contemporary youth media cultures. Creative Publics Lab partnered with national community engagement organization,  Apathy is Boring , to facilitate the production of photovoice projects that document how young people are working together towards progress on local political and social issues. Student projects contributed to the 150 Years Young: a signature initiative of the Canada 150 celebrations, which aims to showcase the diverse, conventional, and unconventional ways young people are building more resilient communities across Canada.Seeing Power: Art and Micro-utopias (Spring 2017)This lab experiment was conducted in conjunction with Education 837, a graduate seminar examining the relationships between contemporary media cultures, aesthetics, and politics. Creative Publics Lab assisted in the development of projects that explores the concept of utopia. Through a series of  workshops , student developed project proposals for speculative micro-utopias – imaginary public spaces and interactions that gesture toward a desired future. Students were encouraged to critically reflect on the current socio-political issues that concern them, chose a theme to focus on and imagine solutions that are unrestrained by time, money, and expertise. Then, with support from the instructors and local practitioners, students engaged in a process of ‘pragmatic utopianism’ – figuring out how they might make their dream projects into reality. Among others, student projects included a pop-up community centre, a summer camp for mental health professionals, an immersive video projection installation, and an intergenerational, intercultural storytelling initiative.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Through collective action, residents have been able to obtain recognition of Yungay as a national heritage site, gaining national and international attention in their struggle for creating a participatory culture among residents in order to be able to determine the future of their neighbourhood with the administration, and not just being subject to its decisions.  Origins and Development  Barrio Yungay is one of Santiago's oldest and biggest neighbourhoods, located in the western part of the city. In 1839, General Manuel Bulnes defeated the Peruvian-Bolivian forces in the small village of Yungay. In the same year, President Joaquín Prieto decided to make Yungay a neighbourhood in Santiago and encouraged settlers to move into and develop the area.  In the 1990s, the neighbourhood was remodelled after being declared a Zone of Urban Renovation (Zona de Renovación Urbana). The municipality of Santiago tried to stimulate the repopulation of the neighbourhood through subsidies. Within this initiative, parks were improved, children's playgrounds built, and cultural activities such as theatric plays, exhibitions and workshops were held in the main square  iv . However, the new buildings constructed clashed with the older existing buildings in terms of size, style, and materials, heterogenising what was once an architecturally homogeneous area. In 2005 the municipality of Santiago altered their trash collection system to disastrous effects in Yungay. Residents gathered in assemblies and designed proposals for alternative trash collection possibilities.  Neighbours questioned the impact of high-rise buildings in their quality of life. The group  Vecinos por la Defensa del Barrio Yungay  (Residents in Defence of Yungay Neighbourhood) was formed in 2006 as an organized opposition to the municipality's modification project in the name of the historic and cultural heritage within the neighbourhood  vii . They demanded the right to participate in deciding the future of their neighbourhood and to participate in the decision-making process in subjects that directly affected them.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The organization does not receive municipal funding; it must solicit private organizations for the funding of individual projects. For instance, RIDYN sought the Fund for the Development of Regional, Provincial and Communal Social Media granted by the Ministerio Secretaria General de Gobierno de Chile, as well as the National Book Foundation in order to publish some issues of their Bello Barrio Magazines.  The organisation also sought Fondart (La Fundación para el Desarollo de Artesanías – The Foundation for the Development of Craftwork) for the development of the Heritage Study necessary for presenting their bid in order to become a National Heritage Site.  RIDYN worked together with the Fermín Vivaceta School in order to restore Yungay after the 2010 earthquake. To offset this effort’s lack of funds, the school charged $40,000 CLP to enrol in the 5-day course, and asked that residents provided their own materials. Later, these same workshops were (and still are) offered free of charge  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Since its inception, the group has held weekly meetings in which different commissions work on themes. These meetings are horizontal and open to anyone who wants to participate and work is carried on on a voluntary basis. Each member can choose a commission to work in depending on his or her interests and for as long as they wish to. Continued participation is guaranteed only by the sense of accomplishment neighbours develop as they see the fruit of their efforts materialise, that is, being able to actively contribute to changing the neighbourhood into a better place, not just waiting for the Municipality to come up with a solution and apply it  viii .  After the unveiling of the modification plan neighbours started weekly meetings in order to discuss the modification project and its effects in the neighbourhood. In the first meeting, only six residents appeared. In the coming weeks, the word was spread around the neighbourhood about their existence and more people showed up. Attendees were not only residents of Yungay, but also former residents and the general public interested in its preservation  ix : youths, artists, professionals, cultural managers, migrants and older adults are always present  x . Within these meetings, strategic action lines have concentrated on the following themes:The legal protection of the neighbourhood through the declaration of national heritage site;  the consolidation of a cultural network in the neighbourhood;  the establishment of a sustainable neighbourhood;  generating exchange opportunities with other neighbourhood;  the creation of a national network of heritage zones;  the creation of subsidies for home owners who live in national heritage sites;  alternative proposals to the modification of Chilean town planning law (Petrowitsch 2012)  xi .According to members of the RIDYN, there are no assigned roles within the group. Each participate voluntarily and contributes with what they can. There is, nonetheless, a core group of 20 active members that are always involved in the activities of the organization  xii . These assemblies prepare the councils and make a pre-selection of the themes that will be there debated.  The weekly assemblies are still being carried out.  Major Projects and Events  Residents in Defence of Yungay Neighbourhood mounted an  effective campaign  against municipal development plans, eventually getting Yungay designated as a National Heritage Site.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Through encouraging resident participation, Vecinos por la Defensa del Barrio Yungay has allowed residents to take a newfound interest in their neighbourhood. Residents now actively participate in rehabilitation efforts, in tourism workshops, and in festival planning. Through these efforts Barrio Yungay is transforming itself from a once abandoned, dilapidated neighbourhood to an energetic, attractive area that draws in outsiders. These changes will hopefully have a positive economic effect on the neighbourhood as property values and tourism rates increase.  The horizontal organisation, the fluidity of participants as well as the lack of a written public protocol of the assemblies and councils makes it difficult to assess the internal working of the organisation and their decision-making practices. Such lack of information can lead one to wonder how much influence general residents truly had in these recent changes in their neighbourhood.  RIDYN faces a series of difficulties such as its inability to attract more residents within Yungay to participate in its assemblies and councils. Because citizen participation is a recent event in Chile, transforming it into a binding force in the various levels of governance instruments within the Chilean government is still a challenge.  As the organization looks to maintaining its future, it needs to establish a written, well-known set of guidelines for the way it is managed. This will ensure two things: 1) that the organization’s momentum and goals will not disappear when its current leaders retire, and 2) that residents’ voices will be guaranteed to be heard in a system of checks-and-balances. Currently no system is in place to ensure either of these factors crucial to the organization’s, as well as the neighborhood’s, permanence.

Gen Why Media’s mission is to re-invigorate political participation through cultural production and works across generations in collaboration with non-profit organizations, governments, universities, businesses, and community groups.  Origins and Development  Gen Why Media was formed by Tara Mahoney and Fiona Rayher while attending Vancouver-based, non-profit film school, In Focus Film School. The two women made a short documentary titled  Generation Why  that explored the potential of Generation Y (people born in the 1980s and early 1990s) to change culture and social structures for the better. The film was well received and the screenings were well attended, which eventually grew into a non-profit specializing in civic engagement.  Organizational Structure and Funding  Gen Why Media is run by the two founders, Tara Mahoney and Fiona Rayher, who make the decisions for the organization. Occasionally it hires workers on contract to suport larger collaborative projects.  It is funded by a combination of grants and fee-for-service contracts.  Specializations, Methods and Tools Used  Gen Why employs several methods and tools to provide a wide range of opportunities and forms of public engagement:Event production and cross-generational dialogues;  Consultation on engagement strategy, audience research and communication design;  Media Production (documentary film, short videos and interactive web production);Social Innovation Labs ;  Participatory public art ;  Public Policy Collage ;  Photovoice ;  Micro-utopiasMajor Projects and EventsCreative Publics Lab  - An emergent project that reimagines the university as a place to develop new political practices.

Its mission is to use art and technology to educate youth about democracy. More specifically the organization seeks to increase youth voter turnout, increase youth engagement in their communities, and to promote dialogue between youth and elected officials.  Alongside its year-round activities, the organization conducts youth mobilization campaigns during federal, provincial, and municipal elections. The organization has several unique characteristics. Its work targets youth between the ages of 18 and 35 – those who are eligible to vote, but are no longer at school and less likely to live with a parent. Apathy is Boring also focuses its efforts on youth who are not currently engaged in the democratic process, be it as voters or by other means. This distinguishes its work from other organizations that work through schools or focus exclusively on young leaders. The organization relies heavily on research from the social sciences to inform the structure of its programs, and also conducts its own research.[1] In the past, Apathy is Boring has conducted studies on behalf of Elections Canada looking at electoral accessibility as well as youth.[2][3]  Origins and Development  Apathy is Boring began in January 2004 when founders, Ilona Dougherty, Paul Shore, and Mackenzie Duncan saw that many of their peers felt disengaged from the political process. When the 2004 Canadian Federal Election was called, work began on what would be A is B’s first federal “Get out the Youth Vote” campaign. Using a website, digital media technology, concerts, and a media outreach campaign, A is B was able to reach over 500,000 young people in Canada in less than four months. Following this successful campaign, the founders of A is B began to build their vision into an organization which included local events such as “The Civic Duty Concerts” in Montreal which featured acclaimed Canadian artists such as Euphrates, K'naan, Tumi and the Volume, Taima and Chris Brown and Kate Fenner. A Is B has continued with its mission by organizing concerts and events, creating a clothing line, making public service announcements that were shown in theatres.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  A is B has grown to have a full-time staff in eight cities across Canada. Their board of directors is also made up of influential community members from coast to coast. In addition, they have developed an online presence on  social media  platforms that attracts hundreds of active supporters and volunteers.  Apathy is Boring receives funding from the following revenue streams:Foundations and government grants  Donations  Consulting revenue  Workshops and presentations  In 2008, Her Excellency, the Right Honourable Michaëlle Jean, Governor General of Canada, became A is B’s organizational patron.Specializations, Methods and Tools  Apathy is Boring employs a number of different participatory methods and tools to engage youth. While many of their programmes are focused on  civic education  and  community organizing , some methods are specific to the goal of each project:VOTE Program : Works to increase youth voter turnout rates through information and mobilization campaigns in federal, provincial and municipal elections. They also conduct research projects focused on improving youth mobilization tactics.[4]RISE Program  : An initiative under Canada Service Corps, RISE is designed to help young people find ways to co-create community projects and contribute in strengthening our civic and democratic fabric by engaging on topics that interest them.[5] RISE hubs are currently operating in Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal and Halifax.Youth-Friendly Program:  Gives civil society and government the concrete tools they need to engage youth in decision-making, through  workshops , organizational audits and other resources to support organizations as they reach out to and engage young people aged 18-30 in decision making.[6]Workshops and presentations:  Conducts a variety of educational workshops targeted at both youth and those who want to work with youth. The workshops cover a range of topics based on outreach to youth.AisB also makes use of information and communication technology to get in touch with and involve youth and those interested in working with younger demographics. Uses of  ICT  include the website  apathyisboring.com ;  social media  including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram; and Citizen Factory.  Major Projects and EventsIn 2005, A is B launched  www.youthfriendly.com  in partnership with the Department of Canadian Heritage to offer youth friendly workshops for “adult” organizations who want to better engage youth in their work.  In the fall 2007, A is B testified in front of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedures and House Affairs about changes to the Elections Act.  In 2008, A is B completed its concert series “Every Party Should Be Democratic” in conjunction with its third Canadian federal election outreach campaign. In addition to two Youth Dialogues with the Governor General of Canada, A is B co-produced a series of four concerts, featuring well-known Canadian artists Hedley, ill Scarlett, Theo Tams, K'naan, and Jully Black, among others. A is B also produced a PSA that aired on MuchMusic Television, advertised in free weeklies in every major Canadian city, and undertook an online campaign “Democracy is More than Voting”, urging youth to make an informed decision in the fall 2008 Canadian federal election.  The 150 Years Young (2016-17): 150 YY project brought together community partners and 12 City Ambassadors (representing Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver) to tell stories about youth in Canada through creative installations and dialogue - both online and offline.  #5MMV Canadian Federal Election Campaign (2015): The #5MMV campaign was online/offline campaign to engage young people in the 2015 Canadian federal election. Street Teams attended concerts from coast to coast, handing out election resources and answering questions their peers had about when, where and how to vote.  From 2014-2018, a partnership between Apathy is Boring and Elections Alberta worked to increase voter turnout in the province through community workshops and a registration drive.  In 2018, the RISE program was launched in Edmonton, Montreal and Ottawa giving 19 youth ambassadors opportunities to develop community impact projects around the topic of social inclusion. A hub in Toronto was added for Cohort II in the Fall of 2018.  In 2019, RISE focused on the issue of the environment. Vancouver is added as a fifth hub for Cohort IV.  Apathy is Boring mobilized youth voters in the spring of 2019 for the Alberta election and in the fall for the Canadian federal election. Their campaign reached more than 2-million young Canadians across their social media platforms.  In 2020, RISE expanded once again with hubs now in Winnipeg and Halifax.  Youth-Friendly Audits: Provides in-depth analysis of an organization’s youth engagement practices and offers concrete next steps to improve and build on current practices. Youth-Friendly Audit clients included the Canadian Red Cross, the National Association of Friendship Centres (NAFC) and several municipalities in Ontario.

[1]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingKnow how this organization operates internally? Help uscomplete this section!Specializations, Methods and ToolsPublic DebatesThe foremost method of participation the Authority is tasked with invoking is the  Public Debate , ""a process of information, public comparison and participation"" on works, projects or interventions that are of particular relevance to the region's environment, territory, landscape, society, culture, or economy. Debates usually take place in the preliminary stages of drafting a project and make use of a number of deliberative tools to engage the public including:The dissemination of technical documentation  Testimony and meetings with experts and scientists  Thematic forums, dialogues or other forms of discussion among citizensThe use of the Internet and new information technologiesPublic Debates are mandatory for works that exceed 50 million euros. Below this threshold, it is up to the Authority to evaluate the project and determine whether it mandates a public consultation. A Debate can not be held on issues which fall under the Regional Law 62 of 2007 (""Regional Referendum Framework provided for by the Constitution and by the Statute"") which determines a  referendum  sufficient public consultation.Support for Local Participatory ProcessesChapter III of the Regional Participation Law (46, 2013) calls for the economic supports of local participatory processes approved by the Authority for the Promotion of Participation. The APP's evaluation is based on several conditions and requirements. In particular, the relevant bodies or officials must agree to take the outcome of the participatory process into account in their final decision or else to adequately and publicly justify the reasons for the failure or partial acceptance of the results. As well, the participatory process must have a specific topic or well-defined scope and be held for a maximum of six months. Appropriate methods and tools must be used to ensure maximum inclusiveness and the expression of all points of view (within reason).[2]  Major Projects and Events  To date, the Authority has approved three public debates:Public debate on the planned development of the Port of Livorno (2015)Public debate on the Florence Airport (2014-2015)Public debate on the restoration of mining activities in Gavorrano (2016)As well, the Authority has approved Regional funding and support for 59 local participatory processes.[3]  Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Please help usverify its content. Mission and Purpose  The Participatieraad (participation council) is a permanent institution that has been set up by the municipality of Haarlem, in the Netherlands, to give solicited and unsolicited advice to the municipal council.  Its aim is to make sure that the opinions and interests of all citizens are heard and taken into account in the formulation of policy, including those from groups which are traditionally less able to find their way through the bureaucracy of local politics.  Specifically, the Participatieraad effectively institutionalizes citizen participation in three ‘domains’ of municipal policy:Healthcare, housing and wellbeing  Work and income  Diversity and the multicultural societyTo this end, the council consists of 15 people roughly representative of the population of the city on a number of characteristics, and aims to actively engage additional citizens who are directly affected by the particular policy under discussion at any given time. This points to a second purpose of the Participatieraad: to ensure its members represent the general population of Haarlem and to encourage them to reach out to more people where-ever this is appropriate.  Origins and Development  A far-going decentralization of welfare provision from the national to the municipal level has been going on in the Netherlands since 2010. Starting from 2015, municipalities will become responsible for child and youth care, assistance to the unemployed (and the provision of benefits), and care for structurally ill and elderly people. In light of these changes, the municipality of Haarlem has stated the aim of expanding and modernizing the possibilities for citizen participation in policy making in its program for the 2011-2015 period.  At the time, three advisory councils already existed, with experts and stakeholders in the respective fields of social issues, health care, and urban diversity. The Participatieraad combines these three councils and broadens its inclusiveness. The process of forming the Participatieraad has been directed as much as possible by these three organizations. To this end, an agreement was made in September 2011 that the councils would come with a proposal in September 2012. This proposal led, through some discussions back and forth, to an ordinance with which the municipal council agreed in June 2013. The Participation council was officially installed on the 24th of September 2013.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Participatieraad was founded by the municipality of Haarlem and its three older advisory councils. Although the council is supposed to be fully independent, it is financed fully by the municipality of Haarlem.  The budget of the Participatieraad (as determined by the municipality in its decision to support its founding) is as follows:Compensations council members (15 members, 10 yearly meetings): €16.000  Compensation chair: €4.000  Particpation-award: €5.000  Other costs for organizing meetings, consulting experts, research, organizational costs, recruitment of new members: €30.410  Total: €55.410In addition, the municipality has reserved €13.000 in its own budget for support of the Participatieraad.  Membership of the Participatieraad needs to fulfill two criteria:Be representative of the general population of Haarlem regarding: origin, gender, age, illness-status, employment-status, and other relevant characteristics.  Be fairly distributed in primary interest across the aforementioned three focus areas.In addition, they need to reside within the municipality of Haarlem, and cannot have any direct business ties with the municipality be employed by the municipality, or hold any representative position.  Members are recruited in a process which starts with a campaign in the local media to encourage applications. A recruitment committee reviews the applicants and selects the new members. This committee consists of the chair and two members of the Participatieraad, plus a representative of the municipality. Members are selected for a period of at most four years, and can participate for a maximum of two terms. Members can at any point decide themselves to leave the Participatieraad, and are forced to do so if they move out of the municipality. The Participatieraad will try to replace its members gradually, rather than all at once, to ensure continuity.  During the first selection process, in Summer 2013, members of the three former advisory councils replaced the (as of then not yet existing) members of the Participatieraad in the recruitment committee.  Specializations, Methods, and Tools  The Participatieraad offers solicited and unsolicited advice to the municipality council on current issues and policy within the three focus areas of healthcare, housing and wellbeing; work and income; and diversity and urban multiculturalism.  The Participatieraad organizes monthly public meetings (excluding the summer months July and August). These meetings are held on the first Tuesday of every month, and an effort is made to make them known to as many people as possible. To give an indication, in the February 2014 meeting 140 participants joined in. These people are obviously self-selected though.  While priorities are discussed during the monthly meetings, advice is developed over a longer stretch of time. The Participatieraad tries to involve many people, stakeholders, experts and affected citizens, in the formulation of their advice. Depending on the issue at hand, this can take the form of collecting the experience of other citizens with services offered or regulated by the municipality, or conversely, the municipal council can ask the Participatieraad to assess whether information or services provided by them are sufficiently accessible and intelligible for all citizens.  The Participatieraad also organizes an annual Participation Award: an award for the initiative or project that contributes most to the creation of a more open and tolerant society and which stimulates citizens to be an active part of it.  The Participatieraad has largely succeeded in generating enough public interest to function as a more open and inclusive advisory council. Hard data on the demographic of the citizens involved in the work of the Participatieraad is, besides for the 15 members, not available. It is therefore unclear whether the citizens involved with the Participatieraad are representative of the wider population. Although this is strictly enforced for the council itself, other citizens who are involved by coming to the monthly meetings or giving their input and suggestions are self-selected. On the other hand, some within the municipality have formulated concerns that the focus on representativeness applied to the Participatieraad might lead to a decline in specific expertise applied to the advice given, as compared to the previous expert-dominated and policy-area specific advisory councils. There is therefore a perceived tension between the dual aims of providing expert advice and providing a forum for inclusiveness and citizen participation.  Major Projects and Events  During the last three months of its first year of existence (2013), the Participatieraad formulated four pieces of advice to the municipality. These have ranged from relatively large and abstract (the transition in youth care taken place these years), to concrete and specific (the public transport taxi).

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose  The Constitution Unit conducts independent research into constitutional change and the reform of political institutions. The Unit’s seeks to make real-world impact with its research, informing policy-makers engaged in such changes – both in the United Kingdom and around the world.  Origins and Development  The Constitution Unit was created in 1995 to aid policy-makers involved in changing their constitutions. Constitutions change frequently. Roughly five national constitutions are completely rewritten every year, and another thirty are amended in some way. Many other changes take place without formal constitutional amendment, through shifts in constitutional conventions, judicial interpretation, or statute law. This is crucially important in the UK, which famously lacks a codified constitution. Matters such as the UK’s relationship with the European Union, the composition, powers and procedures of the two chambers of parliament, the mechanisms through which citizens can participate in politics, and the territorial nature of the United Kingdom all depend on political decisions, but have broader constitutional consequences.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Unit is housed in University College London’s (UCL) Department of Political Science and, after more than 20 years, it continues to thrive. Professor Meg Russell, Director since 2015, leads research on parliament. The Deputy Director is Dr Alan Renwick, a specialist on elections and referendums. Professor Robert Hazell, though he has retired from the role of Director, continues to work on areas such as the judiciary and the civil service. The Unit is also home to several other researchers and PhD students.  Specializations and Activities  Robert Hazell founded the Unit initially to conduct detailed research and planning on constitutional reform in the UK. While continuing to fulfil that remit, the Unit has branched out its activities, assessing the effects of reforms that have taken place, and researching constitutional and political arrangements beyond the UK. One of the main goals of the Unit is to provide provide timely evidence to policy-makers which has had substantial real-world impact.  One of the Unit’s major focus is the mobilization and creation of knowledge. Housed in the University College London, the Unit frequently collaborates with scholars and practitioners all over the world, drawn from politics, law and the public service. The Unit plays host to visiting researchers, public servants taking research breaks, and others working as volunteers.  Knowledge translation and public education are two further activities of the Unit. Information on their research is made available through their  blog , a regular newsletter and a variety of  events  including lectures, seminars, and conferences. The website contains links to their  reports , free and open to the public.  Major Projects and Events  Two of the most recent projects undertaken by the the Constitutional Unit are the  Citizens’ Assembly on Brexit , the  Independent Commission on Referendums , and a research project on  Improving Discourse During Election and Referendum Campaigns .Publications  The Unit’s publications include reports, books, and articles in both academic journals and mainstream media. They also publish a blog which contains timely information on UK politics and the Unit’s work.  See AlsoCitizens' Assembly on Brexit  (case)References  Northern Ireland Border Poll.

YOP works with a team of passionate, committed and experienced development facilitators (national and international) with diverse professional backgrounds (journalists, anthropologists, lawyers, social scientists, agricultural experts, youth counselors, researchers, accountants and development consultants).  In 2007, YOP started working strategically with municipalities. In 2008 and 2009, YOP, supported by the Welsh Assembly and Voluntary Services Overseas (VSO), develop a Youth Communication Strategy and a National Volunteering Scheme for councils. YOP works in partnership with the Northwest Regional Delegation of the Ministry of Youth and Civic Education, and several national and community development actors and organizations.  In 2009, YOP carried out a survey on youth participation in municipal activities with over 2,000 youth from five municipalities. Based on the results of the findings, YOP initiated the Advocacy for the Development and Implementation of Municipal Youth Policies. This led to the signing of five municipal policy frameworks, the development of seven Municipal Youth Action Plans, and the adoption of three municipal youth policies. Presently, YOP is strengthening the capacities of youth leaders to advocate for the implementation of youth policies in Northwest Cameroon. In 2010, YOP has received support from the European Union, previously by Programme d’Appui a la Structuration de la Société Civile (PASOC), and now the Civil Society Strengthening Programme (PASC). YOP hopes to reinforce its actions and to ensure greater youth participation in community governance. So far YOP has reached over 1,000 youth leaders 15 municipalities in northwest Cameroon.

The 1 Million Women mission is to reach and inspire 1 million women and girls to save carbon by cutting waste and pollution from their daily lives, and empowering them to become agents for change within their own households and communities. The 1 Million Women purpose is simple; the more women engaged, the more carbon saved, the bigger the collective impact on the devastating effects of climate change. [ii]Origins and Development 
 1 Million Women was founded in 2009, by Natalie Isaacs. Natalie was a former cosmetic manufacturer whose life focused on packaging. Inspired to change consumption and tackle the climate change crisis, Natalie realized that everything single thing we do shapes the world we live in. [iii]  She decided to focus on individuals as a way to tackle the climate crisis. 1 Million Women is now the largest women’s environmental organization in Australia, with over 83,000 women having joined the campaign. The goal of the campaign is to cut 100,000 tonnes of carbon pollution. [iv]Organization Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 1 Million Women is run by 7 team members. Natalie Isaacs, the original founder, remains the CEO of 1 Million Women. [v]  1 Million Women also has a number of team ambassadors who reach out to women around the world to get involved in the organization. [vi]Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 1 Million Women specializes in helping its members conserve energy, and cut waste and pollution. The goal of each campaign is to have members cut carbon pollution. The overall goal of the organization is to cut 100,000 tonnes of carbon pollution yearly. [vii]Major Projects and Events 
 1 Million Women has spearheaded numerous campaigns to reduce carbon pollution. Below is a sample of their campaigns: Leave it on the ShelfThis is a pledge campaign to show supermarkets that consumers do not approve of excessive packaging on fruit and vegetables. By signing the pledge, participants pledge that they will leave overly packaged fruit and vegetables on the shelf and choose to purchase products that are not packaged in plastic. Less Meat More BeansThis is a pledge campaign to eat less meat and more beans in order to lower animal agricultural impacts on the planet. Livestock production accounts for large amounts of GHGs.

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose 
 With recent deliberative democratic innovations in America (Oregon),  Canada ,  Iceland  and  Australia  in mind, the Fórum dos Cidadãos serves to regularly hold citizens' assemblies to give a Portuguese citizens a space to deliberate over issues and develop critical reports for concerned bodies.. 
 Origins and Development 
 Cognisant of the growing democratic deficit and the importance of ""transformative"" nature of deliberative democracy, the Fórum dos Cidadãos was established in 2017. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 Fórum dos Cidadãos is funded by the New University of Lisbon and the Gulbenkian Institute of Science and has the support of personalities such as former CDS-PP leader Adriano Moreira, State Councilor Eduardo Lourenço, the former Presidential candidate Henrique Neto, and former ministers David Justino, Margarida Mano, Manuel Maria Carrilho. Most of the organization's full time staff include academics from the University of New York, the University of Leeds, the Gulbenkian Institute of Science, and the Instituto Superior Tecnico. Their Advisory Board is made up of various professionals in the field of democratic innovation including the Jefferson Center's Kyle Bozentko and Kenneth Carty of the University of British Columbia and a lead architect behind British Columbia's Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform.  
 Fórum dos Cidadãos works in partnership with other similar initiatives such as the Jefferson Centre, newDemocracy, and the Sortition Foundation. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 The Fórum's events use the Citizens' Assembly methodolgoy, bringing together ordinary citizens with experts, facilitators, political analysts and other professionals. Once a deliberation is accomplished, the Fórum develops recommendations and disseminates them through online and offline services. These Citizens' Assemblies are regularly organized on diverse and timely issues so public debate can be properly informed and structured , making the pondered, informed voice of the public heard. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 The first Citizens' Assembly organized by the Fórum was held in January 2017. Participants deliberated the question ""how can we improve the communication between citizens and their representatives?"" The conclusions were delivered directly to the President of Portugal and communicated to policy-makers and the wider public.

 The mission of Climate Action Network Canada - Reseau action climat Canada (CAN-RAC) is: 
 “To combat climate change, particularly by building social consensus for the implementation of comprehensive climate change action plans by all levels of government, based on the best available science, with specific policies, targets, timetables and reporting, and to work with Canada’s governments, First Nations, Inuit and Métis, private sector, labour, and civil society for the effective implementation of these plans.” [i]Origins and Development 
 CAN-RAC is a coalition of more than 100 different organizations. The organization believes in investing in climate change solutions to keep families and communities safe across the country. CAN-RAC is the only network in Canada to bring labour, development, faith-based and Indigenous groups together to tackle climate change solutions. CAN-RAC is unique because it is the only network that is mandated to address the climate movement as a whole, rather than promoting the individual goals of organization. [ii]Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 The CAN-RAC coalition is run by a board and a staff network. The staff network handles day to day operations and includes an executive director, operations and outreach coordinator, membership campaign coordinator, international policy analyst, policy research intern, and a director of finance. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 CAN-RAC has three main areas of specialization and activities. 1.Nurturing and Providing Services to Network MembersCAN-RAC works to provide the space and coordination effort needed to get diverse Canadian organizations interested in climate change action. CAN-RAC provides membership and access to climate-related events and policies. Every year, CAN-RAC holds a major conference called ClimaCon. ClimaCon is advertised as the largest convergence of climate heros. The goal is to bring people from all corners of the climate movement together to share and build relationships. 2.Policy Development and Advocacy with Federal, Provincial, and Municipal GovernmentsCAN-RAC uses its position to influence policy development and decision makers. In addition, the network promotes climate friendly policy options. CAN-RAC uses buy-in, from their broad network of organizations that are members of CAN-RAC, to promote these policies.. CAN-RAC also offers credible policy advice on domestic and international climate policy development. 3.Building and Maintaining Canadian Civil Society’s Capacity to Engage in the International Sphere of Climate ActionCAN-RAC’s goal is to bring the work of Canadian organizations to the global stage. CAN-RAC uses its position in the international realm to inspire leadership and highlight the activities that taking place in Canada. In addition, CAN-RAC prepares Canadian organizations for major international events related to climate change by providing regular prep calls and information sharing.  The coalition also hosts a number of bilingual webinars and workshops to help keep their members up-to-date on the latest climate initiatives, information, and actions. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 CAN-RAC hosts a number of major events. Below is a sample of a few of their largest events. 
 1. ClimaCON is Canada’s largest convergence of ‘climate heros’ and creates a space for people from across Canada to collaborate, learn, share, and build relationships.

The goal of the organization is to tackle climate justice issues in three main areas: Human Rights and Climate Change, Women’s Leadership on Gender and Climate Change, and Future Generations. The majority of their work takes placein G40 cities and countries that do not have a large impact on climate change. The organization has completed a number of successful projects and continues to make a significant impact on climate justice for many individuals around the world. [iii]The Mary Robinson Foundation’s mission statement is:To put justice and equity at the heart of responses to climate change, particularly those concerned with how best to respond and adapt to the challenge that it poses for the poorest and most vulnerable peoples of the world  To empower poor and vulnerable communities to speak directly in a way that is effectively heard both about the negative impact of climate change on their ways of life, about its potential for conflict, and about what ought to be done by way of a response, in terms of fairness and justice  To facilitate a hearing for such communities to be able to voice their concerns about the negative impact of responses to climate change which are too rooted in technology and as a result insensitive to time and place  To help shape an international framework which minimizes the negative impact which climate change is having on poor communities around the world  To imprint on future generations, of leaders in this field and in society generally, a strong sense of the inter-connectedness of climate change with issues of development and social justice through the promotion of a strong human rights dimension to university learning and education on climate change  To build a shared space for information and knowledge-sharing on climate justice which is accessible to all and a source of solidarity for those concerned about climate change  To catalyze the work of activists, individuals, groups and networks, to further the implementation of the Principles of Climate Justice  To promote the development of technologies that result in sustainable development and promote a better quality of life among the poor and vulnerable [i]Origins and Development  The Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice was founded in 2010 by Mary Robinson. Mary Robinson, the first female President of Ireland, was in power from 1990-1997. She was also the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights from 1997-2002. During her time with the UN and as the president of Ireland, Mary was deeply affected by the extensive suffering she witnessed around the world, especially that of women. She took an interest in climate change because of the impact it had on people. Determined to dedicate resources to combat climate justice issues, Mary Robinson established the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice on February 8th, 2010 under the Innovation Alliance of Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin. Both Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin generously supported the Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice with significant donations. [ii]Today, the Foundation is based in Ireland but works globally to tackle climate justice issues.The organization has completed a number of successful projects and has made a significant impact on climate justice in many countries. Their work typically focusses on G40 countries which do have a comparatively smaller impact on climate change. Mary Robinson continues to act as the president of the organization. [iii]Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice is run by a board of trustees, with a CEO. Mary Robinson, as acting president of the organization, provides visionary leadership for the organization. The organization’s board of trustees and CEO are responsible for decision making. In addition to the CEO and board of trustees, the Mary Robinson Foundation has an International Advisory Council which has extensive international expertise and experience. They are available to provide guidance to the CEO and board of trustees. [iv]The organization pays its employees. It is a non-profit organization that is funded by a variety of organizations and donors. The initial funding for the organization was supplied by Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin. Today, the organization is sustained through government funding, donors, and investments. Financial decisions are managed in a top-down way, with all decisions made through the CEO and the board of directors.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Mary Robinson Foundation takes a participatory approach to much of their work surrounding climate justice. They focus their work in three main areas: Human Rights and Climate Change, Women’s Leadership on Gender and Climate Change, and Future Generations. Within each of these categories, the Mary Robinson Foundation uses a three-prong participatory approach: Leadership, Bridging, and Convening. This method allows the organization to use its unique position among civil society and policy makers to bring a participatory approach to stakeholder engagement to promote climate justice.Leadership  :The Mary Robinson Foundation has established itself as a thought leader (or an informed opinion leader in their specific field) on climate justice. The organization continues to be on the cutting edge of development in the field of climate justice. [v]Bridging  :The Mary Robinson Foundation builds bridges between people and disciplines. For example, the Mary Robinson Foundation worksto connect grassroots women lead initiatives with policy makers and world leaders. These connections directly convene and amplify the voices of the vulnerable. While other organizations in similar positions use a siloed approach (keeping experts and those within the process separate), the Mary Robinson Foundation works the opposite way. It strives to build bridges between the experts and those who are part of the process. [vi]Convening  :Mary Robinson is the organization’s largest convening power. Mary Robinson’s platform and international recognition allows the organization to bring a number of actors together. This is one of the organizations largest strengths. For example, they are able to convene the UN, government, and civil society partners on cases. On addition, the Mary Robinson Foundation always emphasize gender balance during convening processes.  [vii]In addition to using a Leadership, Bridging, and Convening approach, the Mary Robinson Foundation uses the Principles of Climate Justice to guide their decision making. [viii]  The Principles of Climate Justice demands a “leave no one behind” approach and seeks to ensure a human-centered approach that safeguards the rights of the most vulnerable . The Principles of Climate Justice are: Support the Right to Development, Share Benefits and Burdens of Equitably, Ensure the Decisions on Climate Change are Participatory, Transparent, and Accountable, Highlight Gender Equality and Equity, Harness the Transformative Power of Education and Climate Stewardship, and Use Effective Partnerships to Secure Climate Justice. [ix]Major Projects and Events  The Mary Robinson Foundation has initiated a number of participatory projects around the world. The organization categorizes their work into two main areas – case studies and special projects. Below are a few examples of their case study work. These cases focus on people centered climate action and climate justice.1.Women’s Participation – An Enabler of Climate JusticeThis project was a case study that focused on El Salvador, Chile and Vietnam. The project created a policy brief that demonstrated the positive impacts of women’s participation on the design, planning, and implementation of climate policy and in doing so, highlighted the benefits of supporting women’s participation in gender-responsive climate change.  2.  Women’s Land Rights in a Changing Climate: a case study from Maradi, NigerThe project was a case study in Maradi, Niger. The organization worked with women in the region to identify ways to improve local livestock and crop diversity and improve soil and water management. Additionally, the organization helped women in the region pool financial and labour resources.  3.  The Right to Food Security in a Changing Arctic (Canada)This project took place in Canada, Greenland, Alaska and Russia. Arctic regions are facing major changes to food security for the 160,000 indigenous Inuit due to rapidly changing climate and economic situations. This project worked with communities in all four Arctic regions to identify ways to create better food security.  In addition to case study projects, the Mary Robinson Foundation takes on special projects, such as conferences, to further facilitate participatory events. Below are a few examples of these events:Hunger, Nutrition Climate Justice – ConferenceThe Many Faces of Climate Justice: Exploring the Principles of Climate Justice – ConferencePublications  The Mary Robinson Foundation for Climate Justice produces numerous publications including policy papers, research articles, case studies, and briefings.

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose 
 The City of Ottawa has a broader mission and purpose, but the following vision statement captures the public engagement strategy: A City where public engagement is valued as an important part of the decision-making process and is inclusive, meaningful, accountable, and responsive to the public’s perspectives and needs. 
 The City has identified seven guiding principles: Accountable: Provide residents, stakeholders and community partners with information on how their public engagement feedback was considered and adopted, or why it was not adopted. 
 Inclusive: Plan and implement engagement activities that are accessible and respond to the needs of all residents, stakeholders and community partners and that remove potential barriers to participation. 
 Open, Informative and Transparent: Provide clear, relevant and complete information, in plainlanguage at the start and throughout the public engagement process and communicate the purpose, expectations and limitations clearly. 
 Timely: Ensure that public engagement is conducted in a well-timed manner, providing sufficient time for soliciting input, and for reporting back on how the input was used. 
 Adaptive: Ensure that the engagement plan is well tailored to the nature of the topic being discussed and flexible enough to be modified during the public engagement process, as needed. 
 Continuously Improving: Evaluate each public engagement initiative by seeking input fromparticipants about the process and the content. Evaluate on an ongoing basis in order to improve the quality of the public engagement process over time. 
 Co-operative: Build and maintain positive, respectful, and co-operative relationships with residents, stakeholders and community partners in order to increase the effectiveness of public engagement. Origins and Development 
 The City of Ottawa was founded in 1850 under the name Bytown and has conducted public engagement activities for many years. 
 In 2003, a ""Public Participation Policy"" was approved by Council and consisted of ""core values"" and""key principles"" as opposed to a specific policy. Under this policy there were both successful and less successful events which prompted the City to identify the need for a Public Engagement Strategy in its 2011-14 Strategic Plan. 
 However, it was not until 2013 that the City decided to systematize their approach. The City organized a series of public consultations and produced a City of Ottawa Public Engagement Strategy. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 The Public Engagement efforts are housed out of the Service Innovation and Performance Department which is funded out of the City general revenues. The City of Ottawa derives its income from three sources: Property Tax Levy, User Fees, and Grants and Subsidies. Budgeting for consultation is assigned on a per-project basis but permanent city staff tend to be responsible. 
 The City of Ottawa’s public engagement function is decentralized with project consultations prepared and delivered by the relevant City Department (e.g. Transportation Planning, Parks and Facilities Planning). A Staff Toolkit was developed in 2013-14 by a Public Engagement Interdepartmental Staff Committee that provides staff with guidance and relevant information for conducting. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 City of Ottawa Public Engagement conducts hundreds of engagement events annually. Most of these events are small scale and involve the day-to-day infrastructure and planning functions of a typical Canadian municipality. A typical consultation consists of a survey, an invitation for direct feedback and oftentimes several consultation events. 
 There is no one way participants are selected by the City of Ottawa, with different consultations targeting different groups. The Equity and Inclusion policies of the City of Ottawa require specific consideration made for groups that have historically been marginalized in planning decisions. That said, most consultations are open to all residents of Ottawa. 
 Major Projects and Events 
 The City of Ottawa differentiates between public engagement for smaller-scale projects such as a playground replacement and major projects which in September 2018 were identified as: O-Train Confederation Line 
 Ottawa Art Gallary (OAG) Expansion and Arts Court Redevelopment 
 The Combined Sewage Storage Tunnel (CSST) 
 The Ottawa Central Library 
 Developing LeBreton Flats

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose  Fight for the Future works to keep censorship-free, fully private access to afforable internet, focusing on defeating American legislation that censors free expression through copyright restrictions (SOPA, PIPA bills of 2012), warrantless surveillance and excessive policing, and pushing for the FCC's regulatory support for net neutrality to support a level-playing field in access to online services and information.  Origins and Development  Fight for the Future began as a Committee on Political Education (COPE) for the Service Employees International Union , which has 2 million members.  The first Wayback Machine archive of their website focuses on healthcare and the 2004 US elections, comparing candidates (George W. Bush and John Kerry), until 2011, when Fight for the Future was established as a fully fledged non-profit with a focus on internet governance.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Fight for the Future is a non-profit which applies for grants and carries out fundraising to fund its operations, from individual and foundation donations. It also has a 501(c)3 Education Fund. Supporters of the Education fund include the Ford Foundation ($300,000)[1], Media Democracy Fund [2] [3] (unclear if their initial $300,000 grant was co-sponsored with or additionally matched by Ford[3], and whether the 2012 announced $759,000 additional grant came through in that amount [4]), the Wallace Global fund ($40,000 [5]), the Knight foundation (unspecified amount), the Open Society Foundations[6, unspecified amount], the State Infrastructure fund, CraigConnects and Ashoka.  The Education Fund IRS forms show the following changes in contributions:  from 2013-2014: $86,111  2014-2015: $312,034  2015-2016: $796,734 + $367,361 from other sources of revenue, and a significant uptick in fundraising expenses in this period, up 81,502 from 17,472 from 2014-2015 and dropping to 45,691 in 2016-17  2016-2017: $726,448 in contribution income.  Other sources of reporting[7] indicate there is a the $1.5 million operating budget from donations from the Ford Foundation, the Knight Foundation, DuckDuckGo ($25,000), Yelp ($10,000), and venture capitalists, but it is unclear whether this is separate from the Education Fund, given the organization's own IRS filings' differences[8]. The non-education fund also received donations from the Shuttleworth Foundation [9], Sonos (amount unspecified), Voqal (amount unspecified), and the Proteus foundation (amount unspecified). FIght for the Future also has lists of donations depending on their size: 3 of at least $10K, 9 of at least $5,000, and 28 people/couples, organizations or companies who have donated at least $1,000; 4 organizations or companies also do secondary fundraising campaigns on behalf of the organization.  Fight for the Future also encourages its supporters to sign up for a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Some VPNs have affiliated with them by promising to donate 30 to 40% of any referral sign-ups back to Fight for the Future's anti-surveillance campaigns.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Fight for the Future has specialized in mobilizing online protests with internet users, small businesses and large tech corporations in order to pressure American legislators and regulators. Their repertoire of action consists on individual-on-corporate as well as individual and corporate pressure on regulatory and legislative anti-censorship and anti-surveillance measures, notably implementing widespread coordinated ""black outs"" where small and large websites stop providing their main service for a day and direct visitors to a petition.  Major Projects and Events  Highlights from the full timeline from 2011-2013Copyright  Fight for our Future began its mobilization against internet censorship by bringing attention to the Senate bill 978 in 2011, with a campaign called FreeBieber. The objective was to show that there was fair use value and commercial innovation to posting performance covers on YouTube instead of enforcing automated copyright.Major artists like Justin Bieber had been discovered after posting performances of song covers, and the campaign received national attention when it was discussed on the Colbert Report and was supported by the eponym himself. The campaign garnered 200,000 petition signatures and coverage on other news outlets and blogs, leading to the bill being dropped. Less than a month later, Fight for the Future focused attention on the House's Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) by calling November 16 the first American Censorship Day, and mobilized two millon petition signers and 84,000 calls to Congress were placed. To continue pressure, Fight for the Future rolled out its first Reddit campaign, where it asked individuals to pressure the GoDaddy webhosting company to come out against SOPA, which it achieved in under a week. It then followed up online mobilization with offline in-person meetings with Members of Congress. This made some senators begin to rescind their support for  PIPA  (Protect-IP Act), the upper-chamber version of SOPA.  Anti-SOPA and anti-PIPA mobilization 2012 reached its height with the January 18 internet blackout, where large and small websites  posted a banner  and made all their other content unavailable in order to direct internet users' attention to the bills, and to mobilize them into contacting Congress. The bipartisan PIPA  bill lost more Republican support  than Democrat among co-sponsors once the Heritage Foundation announced the vote would be included in their reelection scorecards, and redstate.com (a conservative website) vowed to place primary challengers against SOPA House members. Democrats did not turn against SOPA and PIPA as quickly since Democrats held the Senate Majority, and they were pressured by the movie industry against Sillicon Valley. Former Democratic  Senator Chriss Dodd, then President of the Motion Picture Association of America, vowed to punish Democrats  and including President Obama's reelection effort if they turned their back on the censoring bills. Regardless, the pressure from Sillicon Valley and individual internet users' opposition from SOPA and PIPA was so large enough that  Dodd compared it to the Arab Spring . Defections became so widespread that co-sponsors to PIPA widthrew their support and both bills were tabled. A year later, Internet Service Providers working with Hollywood began lobbying for a stand-alone six-strikes policy that would ban consumers from accessing internet access if they had been identified by corporate copyright holders as infringing. Fight for the Future began an  education campaign on Virtual Private Networks on the importance ofprivate internet access as a tool against ISP's monopoly power and surveillance mechanisms.  Surveillance  A second set of issues tied to online freedom focused on government surveilance. Six months after the SOPA/PIPA protests, Fight for the Future picked up on theCyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act of 2011 (CISPA), creating the  Do You Have a Secret campaign in June 2012 to email and call Congress against spying and surveillance. In it, Fight For the Future  quoted a 2009 New York Times piece  that identified the NSA's systematic collection of American's domestic communications as a result of a July 2008 legislative change from the W. Bush warrantless wiretap. The campaign was created a year before the Snowden revelations of the extent of NSA surveillance practices.  In July 2012 Fight for the Future amalgamated tech community companies into the Internet Defense League as a permanent mobilization effort against censorship and surveillance legislation, which rallied against CISPA; Fight for the Future worked with Demand Progress to  deliver over 300,000 signatures two days after CISPA  was reitroduced, and the Internet Defense League kept up the pressure the following months by deploying its high profile company affiliates to recruit other internet companies into fighting CISPA. This included Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian trying to call Google CEO Larry Page and Twitter and Facebook headquarters in a  YouTube video  as part of a shaming campaign, although a few months later Snowden would reveal their silence on CISPA reflected active complicity, not ambivalence. The coallition also used the attention from the Snowden revelations to turn Independence Day (July 4th, 2013) into  4th Amendment (protection against unreasonable search and seizure) rallies  in New York, Washington DC, San Francisco, Dallas, called  ""Restore the Fourth"" .  The San Francisco rally also  directly protested Senator Dianne Feinstein's role in passing the PATRIOT ACT which opened the door to the Bush administration's warrantless wiretaps. In the subsequent weeks the organization  cowdfunded and projected a documentary about NSA  spying in Manhattan, held the Stop Watching Us Rally in washington and delivered 575,000 signatures to Republican congressman Justin Amash (a self-described libertarian and member of the Freedom Caucus). These efforts led to the Reset the Net campaign for privacy rights in June 5th, 2014. Unlike their previous politically-engaging work, this campaign  centered on mobilizing websites, companies and app developers into adopting specific security protocols , especially end-to-end encryption, among other technological fixes like adopting SSL. This was framed as an act of resistance against illegitimate mass surveillance, although there was also a petition for internet users to sign . The campaign was presented as a ""privacy pack"". Companies and website owners would implement technical privacy fixes and also run a  banner  that would not display until midnight June 5th, to present a coordinated message reminiscent of their anti-copyright campaing against SOPA/PIPA. Internet users were also provided with best practices for password protection and private anonymous internet browsing on computers, as well as a list of suggested encrypted chat apps for phones. The campaign had the backing of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden , ACLU attorney Jennifer Granick, and security expert Bruce Schneier, as well as Silicon Valley and NGO support.  In 2015, as parts of the PATRIOT Act hit their sunset clause, Fight for the Future reactivated its anti-surveillance efforts by  l  aunching a campaign to black out Congress , whereby  websites which signed up would identify internet traffic from congressional networks and redirect their traffic to a blacked out banner  and a slew of topless pictures provided by protestors with the slogan #ifeelnaked to symbolize the NSA's mass spying as a digital strip search. Its aim was to defeatthe adoption of  ""compromise"" bills  authored by Senators Feinstein and Burr like the USA Freedom Act because ""the NSA considers the USA Freedom Act completely benign and it will not change their operations in the slightest”, according to Fight for the Future's cofounder, Holmes Wilson, since it would only curtail one of many ways bulk phone records are collected, and would leave other data collection sources and inter-agency backdoor access unregulated. The organization also rebuked the  false dichotomy  of reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act's bulk collection as the alternative to adopting new the new proposed legislation, pushing to let the provisions on mass surveillance sunset on June 1st. The Internet Defense League member sites signed onto the campaign, which were a part of the more than 10,000 websites that had installed the blackout code. The number included non-league members since the campaign gained traction on Reddit's (one of the league members) technology section. Fight for the Future then updated the Electronic Frontier Foundation's ""Stand Against Spying"" scorecard, which covered legislative activity in the 113th Congress (2013-14), to take into account votes taken in the legislative battle over Section 215 renewal and the USA FREEDOM Act, which provided limited reforms of Section 215. Through their Restore the Fourth coalition (led by Alex Marthews and Zaki Manian of Restore), Fight for the Future's (led byTiffiniy Cheng and Jeff Lyon)  new political scoreboard  that accounted for the ambiguity of voting for the Freedom Act, since a Yes/No vote could not be interpreted as support or rejection of surveillance per se. Their political scoreboard showed that African-American legislators were more likely to support reform, while those with a military background or having been part of the intelligence committee were more likely to support the NSA. Importantly, the scoreboard  outlined that partisanship was not a reliable indicator  of positions on the bill's surveillance regulations and disuaded journalists from generalizing probable votes. The Sunset 702 campaign scoreboard also scored how tech companies had reacted to news that they had collaborated with NSA surveillance or been leaking consumer an political information. If companies had supported limiting surveillance, they would be marked as ""Team Internet"", if they supported bils that gave them corporate immunity or supported surveillance, they would be labeled ""Team NSA"". After failing to pass in its November version because it could not overcome Senatorial fillibusters, the amended June version of the Freedom Act passed  despite bipartisan opposition from Senators Rand Paul and Bernie Sanders and Fight for the Future's Sunset Section 702 campaign. The House bill (HR2048), sponsored by Republican Jim Sensenbrenner, promised to increase the controversialForeign Intelligence Surveillance Courtwarrant-obtaining process, but restored authorization for roving wiretaps and tracking 'lone wolf' actors deemed to be terrorists by the Executive branch, and was  heavily criticized by privacy advocates for having too many loopholes , and  the Senate's author of the Freedom Act criticized how reforms were striped  from the original bill.  After passage of the Freedom Act, Fight for the Future launched a  follow-up campaign, End Surveillance , that tied the issue of mass surveillance to censorship, government control, and intimidation against journalists and dissenting activists like those connected with Black Lives Matter, shifting focus to how the NSA's tactics feed into the FBI's domestic operations. The campaign presented the state of surveillance legislation and highlighted the recurring attempts to pass CISPA to formalize data-sharing between private companies' customer data and federal agencies by  providing companies with liability immunity from disgruntled customers , lowering their economic and public relations costs.  The following year, after the 2016 San Bernadino shootings, a California Judge granted the Los Angeles US Attorney's demand (on behalf of the FBI) that Apple create a  backdoor on encrypted phones by disabling the ""wipe disk"" function  if the security pin is entered incorrectly 10 times. Since CISPA's data-sharing arrangement kept stalling 4 attempts in, the government argued that the 1789 All Writs Act should be used to force Apple to cooperate. In response,  Fight for the Future organized protest rallies, Don't Break our Phones,  to support  Apple's appeal  against the court's pro-FBI order. The nationwide local rallies convened in Apple stores around the country at 5:30 on February 23, 2016. Fight for the Future asked that attendants  open their phone and tablet screens to text that read ""FBI, DON'T BREAK OUR PHONES! "" by accessing a  website that Fight for the Future updates to provide new digital protest signs ,  which currently say ""SAVE THE INTERNET""  in reference to their net neutrality campaign; as well as providing a one page flyer with four reasons to oppose the FBI's demand for attendants to distribute to passers-by and media crew.  During the lame duck period after the 2016 election, Fight for the Future made  an attempt at convincing President Obama  to disclose the extent of surveillance programs and their legal justification, delete stored data and pardon Edward Snowden to encourage whistleblowers, appealing to the election results by advocating that the new administration should be forced to build the spying capacity from scratch. The campaign went without response. Under the Trump administration, Fight for the Future tracked Congress extended the Foreign Intelligence Surveilance Act's controversial Section 702's warrantless wiretapping through the S.139 bill, despite a bipartisan pro-privacy amendment proposal to end warrantless wiretapping. Fight for the Future highlighted how bipartisan opposition was met with bipartisan rebuke of the amendment as Democrat House minority leader  Nancy Pelosi and 55 other democrats joined Republicans to vote down the pro-privacy amendment to S.139.  The process was especially complicated by the new President's initial rejection of the FISA extension given his suspicion of wiretaps, followed by a last-minute reversal of opinion. Fight for the Future's digital campaign centered on their Citizen's Veto effort, where people sign up their phone and get a reminder of their lawmakers' voting record on FISA before the next election, as a means of accountability. This method offsets the need to remember particular votes for two (House) or six years (Senate) while triggering issue saliency when it is most necessary. They also provided a link to their  Get Safe privacy toolkit , a step by step guide on protecting privacy by recommending hardware and software changes fine-tuned for specific devices and operating systems, new settings, habits, and additional information links to external sources of information,  like the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Surveillance Self-Defence .  As the Obama-era FCC moved to  adopt privacy rules that would bar internet provider services from being able to share web browsing history , app usage, location and the content of emails and other communications without the explicit consent of each individual subscriber at the end of its second term. The issue was triggered by Verizon's use of 'supercookies"" to track the websites their network users visited and sell the information to ad brokers;  it settled a 1.35 million dollar fine  and put the issue on the FCC's radar. Furthermore, the FCC pledged to review attempts to charge customers for maintaining their privacy, and the preliminary rules passed by a  3-2 vote in March 2016 . The rules only forbade ISPs from selling personally identifyable information, but could still share customer data if it was anonymized so that it couldn't be reasonably linked to an individual. After the November 2016 elections, the FCC charimanship went to former Verizon lobbyist Ajit Pai, who has made putting ISPs on a level playing field to Facebook and Google his priority, subverting net neutrality rules. On tracking, the new Congress cited burdening economic innovation, and Republican representatives (who held the majority) in the House and Senate voted to reverse the FCC rules. 15 Republicans crossed the aisle on a close vote in the House but their opposition was not enough (215 for the reversal, 205 for maintaining the FCC rules). After the vote,  Fight for the Future began sponsoring billboards in states where Senators had voted to remove internet browsing privacy protections,  naming and shaming Senators in their home state by showing their name, picture, how much s/he had received from telecommunication companies, and a link to Save Broadband Privacy campaign where people could sign a petition. The campaign started with bilboards against four members of Congress (rep. Blackburn, rep. Rutherford, Sen. Flake, and Sen. Heller) and was paid for through donations. Fight for the Future's campaign then  attempted to expand their method to other congresspeople who voted to overturn the FCC order, but fell below their target .  Crowdfunding went to billboards in three more states  : rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers in Washington, rep. Bob Latta of Ohio, and rep. Greg Walden of Oregon (sole holdout in the state, according to the Battle for the Net's  Oregon NetNeutrality Scoreboard .  The organization has also  repeated the billboard method  to the net neutrality fight in California against  Assemblyman Miguel Santiago , who was also called out by  local Battle for the Net activists using projectors and Wikipedia edits that changed AT&amp;T telecom as his spouse in protest over the vote. The protest succeeded in bringing national attention to Assemblyman Santiago, and after an about-face that sent the bill back to committee, where it was revived. Once it went to the state Senate, Fight for the Future  campaigned to have Californians contact their legilsators to support SB922 , and has been  adopted .  Given the lack of legal rights, its recent  Security Pledge  addressed company liability in protecting users' data by appealing directly to technology corporations, but has not registered any company pledging to its four data security principles.  Police militarization and criminalization of peaceful protestsIn relation to Black Lives Matter protests, the 2016 women's march, and Fight for the Future's on the ground protest work, the organization has been highlighting the increasing  militarization of police  in the US, and the trend towards state  legislation criminalizing peaceful protests , pointing to how the organization connects digital and  on the ground policing and surveillance against free speech  as part of the same political process, discussing both in terms of reversing Congressional budget allocation for military technology purchases by local police through a  petition drive inspired by the state-violence of Ferguson. Fight for the Future also pointed their members to researcher Zeynep Tufekci's direct link between the Ferguson protests, algorithmic censorship, and net neutrality .. Crowdfunding went to billboards in three more states: rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers in Washington, rep. Bob Latta of Ohio, and rep. Greg Walden of Oregon  Net Neutrality:  Battle for the Net campaign   In 2014 the FCC lost to Verizon's appeal against the 2010 net neutrality order because it chose the wrong legal framework to justify the Open Internet order. In order to remediate this, Fight for the Future joined 85 other organizations to deliver one million signatures in a petition drive asking FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to remediate the issue by reclassifying broadband under the common carrier framework. The organization also coordinated protestors' physical presence by gathering people outside the FCC headquarters in Washington DC for nine days,  touting that the mere promise of a campout led Chariman Wheeler to reach out to Fight for the Future about the possibility of meeting , something that the FCC had rejected when they received the million signature petition. The pressure also helped the two Democrat commissioners appeal to the Chairman to reconsider classifying the internet as a public utility. A Sunlight Foundation machine learning model on a subset (800,959) of the more than 3.7 million FCC comments found that at least 60% of comments were letters written by organized campains, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Nation, Battle for the Net (Fight for the Future), but remarked that that proportion was lower than other high-volume regulatory dockets. A third of the comments were coordinated by Fight for the Future's Battle for the Net campaign, Daily Kos and Free Pressch begain that year (2014) and has become a  spin-off organization ( Battle for the Net)and mobilization arm that supports net neutrality.  Fight for the Future then called on President Obama to fulfill his campaign promise to protect net neutrality through a petition, a twitter campaign, presenting his position as candidate, outlining his powers in protecting net neutrality insofar as mechanisms to reform the FCC. It also helped organize meetings between constitutents and House of Representatives in San Antonio, Texas, in Ithaca, New York, and in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  The Open Internet net neutrality order  was adopted in March 2015 , the net neutrality issue died down until 2017, when the issue was reopened by the new administration's chairman, Ajit Pai, a former Verizon lawyer who had  dissented  and voted against the order when he was FCC commissioner during the previous comission. Fight for the Future called  June 12 2017 a day of action through online protests . It prepared materials for people who signed up, and asked those who did to identify whether they had a large online audience or friend/employer who did. It also called for websites, companies and organization's participation, ranging from the ACLU to PornHub, from Vivaldi to BitTorent (two companies on opposite sides of the copyright debate), backing from the Women's March to the pot-advocacy magazine HighTimes. The campaign tried other previously used methods too, like distributing banners and code to simulate slowdowns and paywalls that replicate what the end of net neutrality might look like, and made it easy for internet users to submit their comments to the FCC and Congress through these banners, push notifications for apps, and social media memes, making participating websites a part of the comment-gathering process and distributing information dissemination to a wide variety of audiences.  The commission does not allow for more than 3 commissioners to be of the same party, and the December 2017  vote rescinding the 2015 order followed a party-line vote of 3-2 . After the FCC vote,  Fight for the Future started its Break the Internet campaign to pressure Congress to reverse the vote through using the Congressional Review Act (CRA), directing contact through  Battle for the Net , which held the  One More Vote operation  for the Senate's vote on February 27, 2018. The Senate supported the move, and the focus of the campaign now lies in convincing the House of Representatives to adopt  the CRA resolution that the Senate passed (52 for -47 against) through a  discharge petition , where House members can force a vote on net neutrality despite the House Leader Paul Ryan's oppostion to bring it to a floor vote.  Furthermore, Fight for the Future is  raising the issue salience of net neutrality during the 2018 midterm election by identifying 23 close House races where candidates opposing net neutrality are vulnerable  to losing their seat, who is running against them and is a supporter of net neutrality and who has no stance, using their scorecard method. For example, in Iowa the Democratic candidate has no stance but the Green party candidate supports it, while the Republican incumbent opposed restoring net neutrality through the CRA. The Vote for Net Neurality campaign also lets Americans sign up for a bot called  HelloVote  that helps them register to vote, contact politicians in the area and inform them on where they stand on the issue. Lastly, it is running local action team recruitment to organize protests, hand out lawn signs and do voter education at the polls in districts it has identified as key, using the Facebook website. It has also put together avatar images and a document with outreach materials (sample Twitter messages and Facebook posts) for internet users. Their Dont Tread on the Net campaign  frames the issue as one of corporate censorship with government support for ISP monopoly and its petition is geared towards Republican lawmakers, calling the FCC bureaucrats that killed net neutrality as part of a big government-pro corporation coallition. By using a modified Gadsden flag, the campaign seeks to highlight the bipartisan nature of net neutrality among the population (83% in general, 75% Republicans, 76% Independents), bringin up conservative support from Justice Scalia and a plea from Julian Assange to President Trump against media monopolies, as well as technologist Tim Berners-Lee. The campaign makes an appeal to Republicans' vulnerability in letting Democrats take the credit for saving net neutrality in a bid to make the pro-neutrality stance as competitive legislatively as it is bipartisan in the population. A third campaign, on August 16 2018 sought to mobilize small businesses' dependence on open and neutral internet access against large ISPs that throttle content, descriptively called  Businesses for Net Neutrality . It asked signors, legally authorized to represent their company's position, to sign a petition that would be distributed to their members of Congress. Their voter follow-up campaing to Vote for Net Neutrality, called  Red Alert , was run through under the Battle for the Net umbrella, and reported on progress.  Fight for the Future has also been  involved in an open-data and accountability effort looking into the charge  that the FCC allowed Comcast to  astroturf  the net neutrality reversal comment process through theCouncil for Individual Freedom, and . The accusation that there was a coordinated effort to fraudulently use the identities of individuals without their knowledge or consent, possibly  from direct breach data or warehouse lists created from data breaches . The evidence gathered is points to bots that submitted at least half a million anti-net neutrality comments using real people's stolen identities in an effort to make it look like legitimate grassroots moblization against astroturfing. Appealing to the Reddit community, and  suppoting the effort of local media in Denver, in reviewing the docket,as well as running its own operation in Tampa, Florida, Fight for the Future and other organizations have helped uncover fraud in the proceedings, which has fuled a complaint (September 20, 2018) by the  New York Times against the FCC's refusal to comply with multiple Freedom of Information Act requests .  International efforts  On the heels of the anti-PIPA and anti-SOPA, Fight for the Future built tools for efforts outside the US, starting with  opposition to  Europe'sAnti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA) which was defeated in the European Parliament , then worked with Canada's  OpenMedia  to  oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)  since  its intellectual property rules echoed SOPA/PIPA censorship proposals , specifically by targetting the Congressional delegation of "" fast track "" authority to the President as an  undemocrative shirk  of the legislative's responsibility to check and balanace the executive branch. In 2016, in conjunction with  Citizens Trade Campaign , and as a  return to their union workers' roots , Fight for the Future co-organized the  Rock Against the TPP series of concerts . The events ran through Denver, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, San Diego, Boston and Pittsburgh from July to November to raise awareness against the TPP, with an accompanying protest petition signature and Congressional call drive effort. It has also come to the  defense of Russian protest band Pussy Riot .  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Fight for the Future's major policy successes have happened when high-volume individual users have been combined with big-clout corporations to levearge regulators and legislatiors. They have also grown their organization's engagement capacity by linking controversial issues to ongoing and long-term vote mobilization strategies. In developing tools like the poltical scorecard and the HelloVote bot, they have made single-issue grassroot participants keep track of politicians' track records and has linked participatory democracy campaigns to votes, duplicating the impact of their work. Other efforts where individual mobilization is not in line with big companies, like the surveillance track, have been harder to advance, and efforts to engage with tech companies on surveillance has been met with silence.  Publications  Fight for the Future is not a research organization so does not publish traditional reports. However, it frequently publishes press releases in the news section [10] and keeps statistics of their campaign engagement in each campaign description. Supplies and explanations are preented in both text and video form.

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose 
 Common Causes's tagline is ""holding power accountable"" and its stated mission is to ""work to create open, honest, and accountable government that serves the public interest; promote equal rights, opportunity, and representation for all; and empower all people to make their voices heard in the political process."" 
 Origins and DevelopmentFounded in 1970 by John W. Gardner, a Republican Secretary of Health Education, and Welfare in the administration of President Lyndon Johnson as well as chair of the National Urban Coalition, it has been characterized as an advocacy group for minorities and the working poor in urban areas (Chapman and Ciment); it started with 4,000 core members to serve as a people's lobby,  and now boasts over a million members and supporters spread out between 30 states and Washington D.C. 
 Before the 1990s, the group was known for efforts to end the Vietnam War and lowering the voting age to 18, from 21. Its 1970s Colorado branch pioneered the campaign for state legislation as the nation’s first open meetings law, which passed in 1972 ( Colorado Sunshine Law for open meetings ). Since then, nearly every state — sometimes with Common Cause leadership— has passed laws that guarantee the people’s access to public records, require legislative hearings be open to the public, and bring more  transparency to government budgets and spending . 
 Post-1990s (using the Wayback Machine internet archiving website, the first snapshot at December 1996) the emphasis had shifted towards the role of money in politics. The 1996 newsletter has an action alert highlighting campaign financing corruption in fundraising, soft money from special interests and a call for action targeting Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott from Mississippi via fax to shape the 1997 agenda on campaign finance reform after the group highlighted the Republican's $7.3 million ""soft money"" fundraising ranging from Fruit of the Loom to the NRA in the  first four months of 1995 . The focus on accountability for money in politics has been bipartisan, as  demonstrated by a call in 1997  for Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate President Clinton's meeting with a Thai campaign contribution which led to the return of over a quarter million dollars given to the Democratic National Committee. 
 Continued focus on corrosive effect of money in American politics is patent when looking at the distribution of specialization and activities of their current work twenty years later, which regained traction after the 2010 US Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. FEC. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 Common Cause is a 501(c)(4) non-partisan nonprofit, which relies on tax-deductible contribution to an organization in their state network, membership services and recurring monthly contribution to the Education Fund planned giving through estate, bequest, a retirement account or life insurance beneficiary; stock and securities gifts, and memorial or tribute gifts on behalf of another person. 
 Financials for it and its education fund are  made publically available on its website . Total revenue for  2017 is reported  at $17,039,285 (~13.94 million from contributions), while expenses ran at $15,361,092; compared to $14,712,392 (~12.19 contributions) revenue and $14,590,280 expenses  in 2016,  and $15,168,101 (~11.96 contributions) and $15,392,595 expenses  in 2015 . 
 A grant from the  WhyNot Initiative sponsored Common Cause's 2016 fourth annual conference  in DC,  ""Blueprint for a Great Democracy Conference "". 
 Common Cause has chapters in 30 states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 The organization's efforts run on the national and state-level, the latter of which are coordinated by local state chapters of which there are 30. They use a variety of methods and tools to accomplish their work include grassroots organizing, coalition building, research, policy development, public education, lobbying and litigation to win reform at all levels of government. 
 Through the network, Common Cause has established a non-profit affiliate for public education, engagement, and research called the Education Fund. It uses grants and tax-deductible contributions to build public engagement on democracy issues and promote the effective citizen participation critical for a healthy, robust democratic society. The organization also provides an 'election-reminder service' to individuals who supply their residence and contact information.Major Projects and Events 
 Its most prominent projects are run through state-chapters (as a function of the federal electoral system) for citizen-funded elections campaigns [see the Campaign finance in Money and Influence section]: a large focus of the organization which influence its other work on issues like vote integrity and media.Common Cause divides their efforts into six main axis of work: 1. Ethics and AccountabilityCommon Cause uses several tactics to hold politicians accountable to ethical standards so they serve the people, not themselves; campaigns are divided by government branches (legislative, executive, and judicial). 
 Legislative ethics 
 Mobilization of activists led to the House of Representatives' creation of an independent watchdog, the Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE), in 2007, and to the passage of the Freedom of Information laws, the STOCK Act that prohibits legislators from profiting from insider information. 
 Executive ethics 
 Currently running a petition campaign under their Executive Ethics module, for Congress to pass the MAR-A-LAGO Act, which would make public visitor logs from the White House and anywhere else the President regularly conducts business, like the Florida estate that lends its name to the bill, as a way of holding President Trump accountable for reversing the Obama policy of publishing visitor logs through legislation. Another initiative under the banner of 'Executive ethics' is the organization's report on the state of the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses. 
 Judicial ethics 
 Successful  focus on the role of money in judicial politics, especially for elected judges' political spending to be disclosed. Efforts by Common Cause to enforce the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, which requires all federal judges to disclose their spouse's employer led Supreme Court Justice (unelected) Clarence Thomas to amend 20 years worth of financial statements and to disclose his wife, Ginni Thomas, as a paid Tea Party activist with the Liberty Central political education group. 2. Money and InfluenceThe Education Fund produces research and reports to document the influence of money in the political process, public education campaigns [targeting candidates or voters? Track record?] on the power of small-dollar donors. 
 Common Cause has identified campaign finance law violations and file complaints with the FEC, including a  complaint against Kid Rock's false Senate run  where he collected campaign contributions without registering, Walmart's  use of illegal methods  to  persuade employees to donate to its PAC  by using Walmart-charity donations filed alongside Public Citizen and the Our Walmart union, and complaints related to the 2016 election related to Russian interference, but their most high profile complaint is the January 2018  filing with the Department of Justice and the FEC  about Michael Cohen's in-kind campaign contribution to Stephanie Clifford to avoid disclosures of then candidate-Trump's affair with her. In response to the Common Cause complaint, Cohen admitted to facilitating the payments in February 2018 and set off a criminal investigation of Cohen with the DOJ. 
 Corporate accountability 
 Common Cause joined the Corporate Reform Coalition in response to the 2010 Citizens United US Supreme Court case. Their goals are focused on a 3-pronged strategy: advocating for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to adopt a rule that would require publicly-traded companies to disclose direct and indirect political spending; supporting efforts by shareholders and investors to pass shareholder resolutions that require companies to publicly disclose their campaign and lobbying spending; and working in the states to pass  disclosure and shareholder rights laws . Common Cause worked on the California DISCLOSE Act,  signed by Gov. Brown in 2017 requires the three largest funders of political ads to be clearly identified at the beginning of ads (TV, radio, print, and online ads) for ballot campaigns and independent expenditures.  Similar disclosure laws have been passed in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Mexico, Maryland, Connecticut, Hawaii, Montana, and Delaware with the help of Common Cause.  It is also supporting a Santa Monica initiative for transparency in the ballot initiatives  (SB 651) to disclose the top 3 funders and committee name of any petition on the petition or a separate document. 
 Lobbying 
 Common Cause works on lobbying laws that require strong disclosure and registration rules for lobbyists at both the state and federal level and stopping the revolving door. It has been instrumental in pushing key lobbying reforms through Congress, including the Lobbying Disclosure Act and the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which provided increased transparency for the American public and extended the “cooling off” period for former public officials before they can lobby their former colleagues (2 years). 
 One area of focus is  ALEC. Using a whistleblower complaint  with the Internal Revenue Service, Common Cause has presented evidence against the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a lobbying group that represents the largest corporations in the US, which crafts model legislations, pays for legislator expenses to go to ALEC conferences  where representatives are lobbied and then campaign-financed to pass ALEC-written legislation  on taxes and budgets, climate change and the environment, workers’ rights and collective bargaining, healthcare, telecommunications policy, election laws, and education. It charges that ALEC has violated its tax-exempt status by operating as a lobby while claiming to be a charity. 
 Campaign finance reform through citizen funded elections 
 campaigns at the state and local levels to pass and improve citizen funded election programs, including in Connecticut; Arizona; Maine; New York City; Los Angeles, CA; Montgomery County, MD; Howard County, MD; Suffolk County, NY; Berkeley, CA; Portland, OR; Seattle, WA; Santa Fe, NM; Albuquerque, NM; and Washington, DC, and  has supported the introduction of federal bills in Congress to create a public campaign finance system based on matching donations , like the Government By The People Act and the Fair Elections Now Act. Connecticut: spearheaded the Citizens’ Election Program (2005)  which uses small-dollar donors and allowing people of modest means to seek and win public office to diversify representation in Hartford's legislature. The program lets anyone running for office apply for a grant of public funds after running a minimum amount of contributions, ranging from 5,000 total for state representative offices to 250,000 for governor. The amount of money received will depend on the stage of election, whether candidates are running unopposed, or opposed by a small party candidate, and the percent of votes cast for a small party in the previous election if running as a minor-party. In the  13 years it has been in use , it has allowed candidates for the state Senate, House, and constitutional offices to run without the need for large-donor contributions. Oregon: with the help of Common Cause , which brought together in a coalition of more than 30 organizations called A Voice for All Portland, the representatives of the City of Portland council launched an opt in Small Donor Election Program for candidates of the 2020 election who agree not to take contributions over $250. In exchange, the first $50 of a contribution is matched by 6x public funding. Maryland: citizen-funded elections  at the county level started in 2014 in Montgomery, then 2017 with the Howard county setting up a program for the 2022 election, and Prince George county is working with Common Cause on an ongoing project; at the gubernatorial level the 2014 election used at he Fair Campaign Finance Fund. Work has also been conducted through the Fair Elections Maryland coalition. 
 Los Angeles, California: active campaign, two primary goals for public financing reform are reducing elected officials' dependence on outside interest's money and allowing people without personal wealth or access to donors but strong community ties to run for office. Working with the   LA City Ethics Commission , the program matches constituents' small dollar donations with public money, which means candidates have a bigger incentive to spend time with their constituents to incentivize donations, in turn voters feel greater ownership over local elections, and are more likely to participate in elections. Their current campaign  supports the LA Ethics Commission's recommendations to increase fund rates to a 6:1 ratio  and raising maximum fund allotments for specific primary and general election. Strengthening accountability institutions like the Federal Election Commission (FEC) , so that it has the power to decide cases and enforce punishments independently, without having to go to court, to stop illegal political activities when issues are raised before elections, instead of retroactive accountability years afterwards; has also worked to push the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to enforce electoral laws so the campaign finance system has a cop on the beat. 
 Repealing Citizens United through a Constitutional Amendment: as a response to the 2010 Citizens United judicial decision that allows interest groups unlimited spending on elections, Common Cause has joined partner organizations to amend the US constitution with an amendment, Democracy for All. A vote was carried out in 2014 in the Senate but a Republican filibuster blocked it. 
 Disclosure and transparency: Federally, Common Cause is currently working on disclosure legislative and executive/administrative reforms that echo state laws and initiatives that have successfully passed in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, California, Montana, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, like: the DISCLOSE Act and Honest Ads Act; petitioning the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to approve a new rule governing secret money groups that abuse the tax law; advocating for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to adopt a rule requiring publicly traded corporations to disclose their political spending to shareholders; pushing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to approve new rules for broadcasters that increase transparency on political advertisements; petitioning the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to strengthen and enforce disclosure rules; urging the President of the United States to sign an executive order requiring federal government contractors to  disclose their political spending.3. Gerrymandering and RepresentationCommon Cause Education Fund is engaged in key court cases with national implications: Common Cause v. Rucho (North Carolina), Gill v. Whitford (Wisconsin), and Benisek v. Lamone (Maryland). In Michigan, Common Cause filed an amicus brief  with former U.S. Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI) and former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-CA) after having led the effort to create a citizen redistricting commission in California and other states, in order to support the Voters Not Politicians ballot initiative, which was under review by the Michigan Supreme Court  following a well-funded special interests lawsuit to keep the initiative off the November 2018 ballot. In August 1st, the Michigan SC voted 4-3 to reject that lawsuit, meaning the state voters will vote on whether to change redistricting powers by stripping state legislators of their power (which often leads to political gerrymandering) in favor of an independent citizen redistricting commission who would draw the U.S. House and state legislative districts after each decennial census. Colorado, Missouri and Utah – are also looking to the November 2018 ballot to approve proposed redistricting reforms; Ohio approved reforms in May 2018. 4. Voting and ElectionsExpansion of voting rights and election integrity through several initiatives. 
 National Popular Vote drive 
 To avoid presidential candidates winning the electoral college without having won the popular vote, as two of the last five presidential elections, and to create campaigns that are more responsive to all Americans instead of swing states, Common Cause is lobbying for a states to  join the National Popular Vote Compact, so they allocate their votes according to the national popular vote winner instead of the state winner, which means no constitutional amendment would be necessary. Washington, California, Illinois, Maryland, New jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Vermont, Hawaii, and DC, have joined the compact. 
 Protection of the right to vote 
 After the 2013 Supreme Court revisal of the Voting Rights Act, Common Cause is pushing for the adoption of the Voting Rights Advancement Act (VRAA) would restore the VRA’s critical voting protections, and to fight back on 20 states' recent voting restrictions (cutting early voting, strict voter ID requirements, rolling back reforms). 
 Voter registration modernization: 
 implementation of four methods that increase turnout: automatic voter registration through motor vehicle agencies that keep systems up-to-date, same day registration during election day, registration online through secure government websites, and pre-registration of high school students which is automatically activated when they turn 18. Because voting is organized by states, Common Cause has worked with 13 states on adopting Automatic Voter Registration that reaches voters despite their party preference. The 2017 report by the US Election Assistance Commission documented how after Oregon's automatic voter registration law passed, there was a 12% increase in registered voters, Vermont's added more than 12,000 voters in the first six months after passing in 2017, almost double the amount in the previous (election) year. 
 Election Protection: 
 Common Cause mobilizes volunteers to be on the ground to be poll monitors, and teams of legal experts on a hotline that fights back against voter suppression and illegal intimidation practices. Patterns and practices are studied and brought to the attention of administrators to preempt their repetition and to diffuse hotly contested races where confusion and complications may be more likely. Monitors also help inform voters in real time. 
 Election integrity: 
 Common Cause delineates risk-limiting practices that protect from cyber-attacks and ensure accurate, secure, and fair elections against domestic and foreign vote-counting hacks through upgrading technology against old and outdated voting machines, and returning to paper ballots in every state, post-election audit of ballots, paper back-ups of voter registration databases and electronic voter rolls. Publication of a state-by-state assessment and state-of-technology of online voting and its points of vulnerability (see publications, The Secret Ballot at Risk). 
 In 2018 it, along with the Brennan Center for Justice, Common Cause, the National Election Defense Coalition, and Verified Voting  published a toolkit  for advocates and election officials to put to use the $380 million Congress approved for administration officials' election technology and electoral security. Replacement of machines that do not retain paper records (direct-recording electronic machines that store records directly onto the computer memory) for recounts and audits must be replaced immediately with voter-marked paper ballots (VVPATs) to follow best practices for post-election audits, replacement of machines where the vendor cannot service the original software or where machines are no longer manufactured and thus any hardware malfunctioning  cannot be replaced unless parts are found by third party unregulated vendors. 33 states reported equipment must be replaced by 2020 and 22 of these states do not have the funds to do so. The toolkit places emphasis on the need for systems that allow for secure post-election audits which are ensured by voter-marked paper ballots, and that voting equipment not have wifi capability. Finally, Common Cause has made a political argument  that candidates who win within a framework of insecure voting machines must put country over party and secure voting machines as part of a paradigm shift which echoes the Netherlands, France, Britain and Germany's rejection of machine counting of votes. 5. Media and Democracypromotion of free speech and accountability in the media through the Common Cause Education Fund, working towards protecting an open internet against media monopoly consolidation, for affordable high-speed internet access. Currently, it is running a campaign in California for the Social Media disclosure act (AB 2188) as a follow up to their supported California Disclosure Act ( passed with support from Common Cause, signed by Governor Brown in 2017 ), requires all online social media platforms to include ""who funded this ad"" information on sponsored posts, which will list the top three funders of the ad, disclosing advertisement and public information on political ad funding on social media. 
 On net neutrality, Common Cause has Michael Copps, former FCC commissioner during the W. Bush administration and acting Chairman during the first six months of the Obama Presidency, as special advisor. 
 Successful efforts for net neutrality 
 In Oregon, Common Cause helped the state pass a net neutrality bill that requires state and local governments to do business only with ISPs that  observe net neutrality protections, which was signed into law by Governor Kate Brown in April and kicked in in June , although their law is less restrictive than Washington state's. Oregon has led states rights causes in the matter of net neutrality, being the first to unexpectedly pass their bill, with overwhelming public support. New York, the Common Cause chapter joined advocacy groups  in 2014 to oppose the Comcast-Time Warner merger, and the Public Service Commission rejected the deal. 
 Ongoing: 
 In California, they are supporting SB 822, which mandates net neutrality in the State, and prohibits state agencies from using or funding ISPs who violate net neutrality principles, and has been  called the ""gold standard"" of net neutrality  for  its stringent protections . 
 Colorado: informal (no concrete legislation in the works) congressional lobbying to reinstate net neutrality protections. Common Cause Colorado also works on high-speed internet access, has informal efforts to combat the 2005 state act that restricts communal and municipal networks by requiring a ballot initiative at a cost to municipalities. New York: fighting the FCC  so that New York can enforce its own open internet rules given the FCC's reversal, and supporting federal efforts to use the Congressional Review Act to reinstate Obama-era net neutrality rules. 
 Other NY efforts: Common Cause has an informal effort for closing the digital access divide, especially in rural areas, poor urban neighborhoods and tribal land, but particular initiatives are not explicit. They are, however, fighting the monopoly power or telecommunication companies by  forming a coalition with the Consumer's Union under the Waiting4FiOS campaign  which calls for and aggregates consumer interactions with Verizon in order to pressure them to complete building their Fiber Optic Service as per its 2008 NYC franchise agreement, to sign a petition for the NY city council, and to attend official public forums. 
 Rhode Island has an informal axis for net neutrality but no concrete plan of action at the state or state-to-federal level. 
 No explicit effort on Media and Democracy in general, nor net neutrality specifically: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. 6. Constitution, Courts and other Democracy Issues:Rejecting an Article V Constitutional Convention: 
 Common Cause is ringing the alarm against the constitutional convention that wealthy special interests (ALEC and the Koch brothers' organizations) are pushing to convene for a constitutional convention to adopt a ""balanced budget amendment""  as a means of forcing cuts to the social safety net, as documented  by  historian MacLean  ( video interview ); and 28 of the necessary 34 states have passed resolutions calling for it to occur. The other proposed amendments, commonly known as the ""Liberty Amendments"" include: repealing the 17th Amendment (popular election of the Senate, in favor of a return to state legislature-elected Senators because state legislatures can be captured by special interests more easily and cheaply), subjecting federal departments to periodic reauthorization and review (which further politicizes their regulatory work), imposing term limits for Supreme Court Justices and restricting judicial review (which also politicizes the courts), creating a more specific definition of Article I, section 8, Clause 3 (known as the Commerce Clause), limiting eminent domain powers, allow states to bypass Congress more flexible by making the adoption of Constitutional amendments easier, including the reintroduction of the concept of nullification of federal laws by states by creating a process where 2/3 of states can nullify federal acts, and requiring photo ID and limiting early voting.Fair Courts: 
 advocacy for a transparent and fair process in selecting judges (additional information on specific campaigns is not available on their website). 
 Legislative gridlock relief: 
 Previous successes have included Senate reforms on silent filibuster rules, transparency in the legislative process, its budget and spending; advocating for no special interest giveaways in budgeting, scrutiny over hearings and processes to screen unqualified presidential nominees to the judicial or executive branches.

 Power Shift makes the case for federal campaign finance in light of the NRA's influence on the Legislative branch, and lists top recipients since 1989 in both chambers. State of the Swamp  [part of the Executive Ethics campaign]: a review of conflicts of interest and ethical challenges of President Trump’s first 100 days in office in a report. Municipal Democracy Index  is a comprehensive survey of the governance, election, and campaign finance practices of all 482 California cities published in 2016. Highlight findings: The 2015 California Voter Participation Rights Act, prohibits cities from holding off-cycle elections if it results in turnout that is 25% lower than state elections: as a result, 31 additional cities have passed laws to on-cycle elections, many in just the past few months. Also as a result of recent legal changes (the California Voting Rights Act of 2001) and ensuing civil rights litigation, many large cities have changed their election system from at-large (city wide  election) to by-district council election. Compounded with this this change, by-district systems review their district map boundaries to ensure substantially equal population representation every ten years, and eight charter cities (prevalent in big cities) have established independent redistricting commissions which are non-partisan [ key findings direct link ;  full report link ]. 
 The Secret Ballot at Risk: coauthored by Verified Voting Foundation, EPIC Electronic Privacy Information Center and Common Cause, the Secret Ballot at Risk Report finds that given current technological standards, letting states transmit ballots online, which is allowed in 44 states, and statutory provisions in the other 6, erodes state-constitutionally protected secret ballot rights which conflict with 32 state's practices given current technological limitations. Alaska makes explicit a warning when voting online that the risk of a faulty transmission may occur explicit on absentee ballots. While risks are addressed, Common Cause is asking states to present alternatives for verifying ballots with privacy envelopes when mailing the ballot, and to use printed ballots mailed or deposited in safe election office drop-boxes.  In an editorial , the organization also advocates for quarantining all ballots received through the internet since a voter's computer integrity cannot be known. These ballots should be assumed to contain malware and results from them should be manually added these tallies instead of introducing them into the system.

 Mission and Purpose 
 The consortium critiques the capitalist business models of corporations that use of open, free and sharable data against citizen privacy and surveillance online and physically (internet of things, IoT).  The goal is to build services that give proportionate and controlled access to code-writters with explicit consent from users through cryptographic technologies like blockchain. 
 History 
 Participant Selection 
 DECODE’s consortium members are from Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, France and the UK. Francesca Bria, Barcelona Chief Technology and Innovation Officer is the project coordinator. 
 Specializations and Activities 
 Decode specializes in building and distributing technological tools for consumer and community engagement that retains privacy. 
 Major projects and events 
 Four European pilot projects are creating platforms and tools that let individuals take back their personal information. They are distributed in Barcelona and in Amsterdam for now.Barcelona 's iDigital / BCNow Platform pilot.  This pilot partner with Barcelona City Council and the city’s digital democracy platform Decidim.Barcelona, to allow citizen-generated data to be aggregated and blended from a range of different sources, including noise levels from individual sensors, healthcare data, and administrative open data. This will be displayed in a BCNow dashboard, and will give citizens the option to control the use of that information for specific purposes, including to inform policy proposals. It will also provide anonymous verification capabilities (such as when creating and signing local petitions) to minimise the sharing of sensitive of personally identifiable data with the city council. Barcelona 's #MakingSense Internet of Things pilot.  Residents will be given noise sensors that are placed in the neighbourhood. DECODE will provide sessions to train and support participants to help them setup and use the  sensors to gather and analyse data to influence city-level decisions. The pilot tackles the technical challenges of collating and storing a stream of citizen-sensed data, while also enabling those citizens to control what information is shared. It builds on a local project, Making Sense, which was established in 2016 and has been co-funded by the European Commision. 
 Amsterdam's  Holiday rental register pilot.  This responds to sharing economy platforms such as Airbnb which have caused disruption in cities such as Amsterdam by pushing up the the price of rents, while legal rules around privacy have prevented effective sharing of occupancy data about hosts who break local legislation. The pilot involves collaboration with the Amsterdam Municipality and the FairBnB platform — which was started to provide a more sustainable solution for short-let accommodation, and reinvests profits back into local initiatives. DECODE will provide statistics and regulatory information to enable the community to govern the platform without compromising participants’ privacy. 
 Amsterdam's  Gebiedonline (Neighbourhood Online) pilot. Gebiedonline is a pre-existing co-operative digital platform that enables local people, groups and organisations to view events taking place in their neighbourhood, share news, exchange and borrow products and services, and to meet people. Amsterdam City Council is keen to spread this to other locations across the city and leverage the platform to increase involvement with policy and decision-making. It provides an opportunity for DECODE to test a more privacy-preserving local social network, with granular controls so that residents can decide what information they share. 
 Funding 
 DECODE is funded by the European Union's  Horizon 2020 (Project no. 732546).It is a three-year project, running between January 2017 and December 2019. In total €5m will be paid to the 14 consortium members undertaking the work. This is the biggest EU Research and Innovation programme ever with nearly €80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020). It is a flagship initiative aimed at securing Europe's global competitiveness. 
 Publications 
 Decode has multiple reports derived from its research[2], as well as basic definitions for its projects. Materials include prototype tools, pilot background research, legal licensing, rules, privacy requirements for projects, and policy documents, templates for methodology and co-creation frameworks,  and a survey on blockchain technology.

 Create a bridging platform with public-facing and government management tools for citizens to make their non-emergency needs known to public officials and other neighbors, who can then organize to manage issues. 
 History 
 The website was created in 2008 by Ben Berkowitz, Kam and Miles Lasater, and Jeff Blasius in New Haven Connecticut as a way for community members to publicly let their government officials know about graffiti, illegal waste dump (two of the most popular categories), other infrastructure needs like cracked sidewalks and potholes, as well as intangible quality of life issues like dangerous zones and areas where reckless drivers put others in harm’s way. With the increasing adoption of smartphones with GPS, cameras, and ubiquitous internet, the website has expanded into an app that streamlines high accuracy reporting; however, the initial website and ethos of SeeClickFix is that government should not be a blackbox. To that effect, since the beginning reporting was open and public facing. 
 Participant Selection 
 The service does not need the permission of local or state officials to work as an organizing platform for citizens and neighbors, but it offers premium management services to governments that want to contract them to streamline public complaints.  For those who prefer not to sign in, people can report anonymously sensitive topics related to their building (SeeClickFix team, Tucker Severson 2015), or to do guest reporting, without the need for an account, which has turned out to be a popular way of reporting on the fly or as a way of protecting citizens' anonymity. 
 This has created a range of reactions from government officials. While some have voiced discomfort at having shortcomings in public services pointed out in a publicly accessible platform, but SeeCLickFix has also seen interest in backend management. In the past 7 years newer developments in SeeClickFix have aimed at helping local governments streamline their “request management” within the bureaucracy. Once the management system is purchased, SeeClickFix has teams that guide the entity through the implementation process, decision-making on rollout, and continued connectivity between citizens’ request and its fulfillment. This means the website has a background component that works with governments to manage their operations. On the frontend, citizens use their phone or computers to log a complaint. The website shows similar requests and their address so users can also see whether someone else has reported an incident, or they can follow through with pictures, or more information like if the situation has deteriorated. After reporting the issue (which can also be reported anonymously) and geolocating it, if the city has enrolled, the user receives an email with the city logo with a ticket number. On the backend, the city works with SeeClickFix to merge their process with the website’s workflow. The office handling requests acknowledges receiving it, which generates an email for the citizen—creating a link between the management office and the SeeClickFix account holder, then assigns it to the correct worker or field agent and can set the due date. 
 The workflow for each city worker is managed through SeeClickFix, which filters by due date and status, links to the phone’s GPS which increases the likelihood that the correct issue will be addressed, and allows the worker to communicate back about each issue with the request managing office. The backend interface also allows anyone manning the reports desk to add other citizens who call in to the email response, creating an internal tally of engagement level, which can also help prioritize high-volume issues, while keeping everyone interested informed about the progress. The information is easily collated meaning departments can keep track of their progress and find areas of weakness in the service requests they are getting. Furthermore, the user has complete ownership of the issue—even after the official says the problem has been fixed, if the complainant disagrees she can reopen the case and challenge that assertion. 
 Specializations and Activities 
 As of 2017  there are approximately 300 organizations enrolled with SeeClickFix, most of which are US municipalities, city or county governments, usually located around college or university towns, across the country [1] . Hospitals and universities are other non-government organizations which have begun subscribing to the public communication and internal management system. In Canada, cities and councils have enrolled in Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan [2] . If a locality is not enrolled as a customer of the SeeClickFIx management system, users can still report problems and set up watch areas, which are public-facing. The city, volunteer organizations, or other citizens can then take action and organize to problem-solve given the website’s commenting capabilities. 
 Users who sign in earn different amounts of “civic points” based on their level of participation (commenting, logging in, uploading images, creating a watch area, having an issue commented on, voted on, or followed up on) and discourages abuse by subtracting points if comments are flagged as inappropriate. These points are then translated into titles, like badges, that indicate status within the online community. 
 Not all reports are for pothole or graffiti. Reports of discarded syringes and other dangerous waste were used by the Burlington, Vermont Public Health Department to geolocate where public drop boxes were most needed, creating avenues for citizens to help with a public health crisis. 
 Major projects and events 
 In 2014 the service got its millionth request. 
 SeeClickFix is an example of how the open government is not enough. As time has passed, the community-centered platform has gained leverage by bringing in governments who are willing to be held accountable into dialogue with their residents, creating a feedback loop around dialogue and capacity-building that has changed the operational goal of the organization too. Beyond government demands, the “talkback” communication aspect of the service has put residents in contact with their neighbors, who in the process of discussing a concrete issue like the need for a stop sign in a cross road can bring attention to a larger issue, like public safety. An issue with high interest can have compounding effects, and can make the government prioritize finding a solution quickly, but it can also bring the community together to solve it on their own or to make it feel empowered in its capacity to be a co-producer of good governance. With time, SeeClickFix has seen these dynamics come out over and over again, and has adjusted its initial model to incentivize and make accessible these benefits to as many communities as it can. 
 Funding 
 Free services for citizens are now sustained by municipal memberships, though it is unclear what the operating costs and funding ratio is. 
 Publications 
 The service has started documenting https://seeclickfix.com/pages/case-studies.html case studieswhich have use figures but does not document ""failure"" cases where cities refused to engage with the service.  The service also has multiple outreach programs: blog posts highlight ways in which the community helps each other learn where to report issues like rogue university bus drivers even when SeeClickFix does not know (SeeClickFix team 2008); their local government GovLove podcast sprang from webinar events (SeeClickFix n.d.) with partner cities which are used to have local governments using SeeClickFix talking to each other (SeeClickFix team; Smith, Caroline 2015), and to give their residents a glimpse of their internal processes and lines of thinking. The webinars themselves have developed into annual conference  workshops  , called GovLove Summits (SeeClickFix team, Caroline Smith 2015).

Its central objective is to inspire a more representative form of democracy, with more deliberation and participation, by establishing aCitizens' Assembly with members drawn by lot, working in parallel with the elected Parliament.  Origins and Development  To achieve this objective, Agora decided to stand in the regional elections in May 2019 in the Brussels-Capital Region. Thanks to the trust of 3629 Brussels voters, the movement won one seat in the Brussels Parliament.  Agora is now organising a Brussels Citizens' Assembly, made up of 89 Brussels residents drawn by lot, whose proposals are then shared in Parliament by the elected spokesperson. At the same time, Agora works within parliament on participative democracy in general, with the particular aim of establishing the Assembly as a more permanent institution.  Through the assembly, Agora hopes to encourage the implementation of true citizen democracy. In addition to its legislative efforts, the Assembly also serves as a tool to inspire better representation, encourage debate and discussion, and increase participation, throughout the whole of society.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  As a volunteer organisation, Agora is organised in working groups, focussing on the assembly, parliamentary work, communication, external relations and internal organisation. Agora is supported by a handful of employees.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Agora promotes the citizen assembly model, and to that end launched the Brussels Citizens' Assembly (BCA) as an assembly consisting of 89 citizens drawn by lot.  This sample is statistically representative of the population in terms of age, gender and level of education.  This Assembly seeks to be deliberative, since the participants have different opinions, and are encouraged to share these, allowing ideas to develop and evolve.  Finally, the system is participatory in the sense that every Brussels resident has a real chance to actively participate in the decision-making process.  Major Projects and Events  Assemblies have been organised since 2019.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Information about the assembly, it's outcomes and parliamentary follow-up can be found on the Agora website!

Please help us complete it.Mission and Purpose 
 The National Street Vendor Association (NASVI) in India is an association of Indian street vendor organisations working to protect the rights of vendors across the country through sustainable macro-level policy interventions. Engineered and promoted by NASVI, the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act was passed by the Parliament of India in 2014. NASVI now works to effectively implement the policy for the welfare of street vendors throughout India. [1]  
 Origins and Development 
 Participant Recruitment and Selection 
 NASVI follows a democratic process for processing and approving membership. Membership is open to Trade Unions; membership-based organisations, such as cooperatives, community-based organisations, and non-governmental organisations. Organisations are required to have more than 50 vendor members or work with more than 50 vendors. If organisations meet the criteria, they can request a membership application form. [2]  
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 NASVI, as a federation, regularly consults and hears from its members from across the country. It is run by a board of members. While leadership has primarily come through civil society organisations, some opportunities appear to exist to rise through the ranks. The organisation also advises on local advocacy efforts by its members. Rules of participation include knowledge and expertise, carrying local legitimacy (federated member organisations elect leaders) and willingness to accept and behave in accordance with membership rules, e.g. regarding transparency and openness, and financial appropriateness.

 The Global Challenges Foundation’s (GCF) objective is to contribute to minimizing, preferably eliminating, the major global threats to humanity. To achieve this, the GCF works in two ways: by increasing decision-makers’ and the public’s knowledge and insight about these challenges; and by stimulating discussion and innovative thinking about decision systems that would be able to manage the major global risks more effectively and equitably [1]. 
 The GCF has identified, what they have termed, five interdependent, global catastrophic risks: climate change, other large-scale environmental damage, politically motivated violence, extreme poverty, and population growth [2]. The organization has also identified two major barriers to addressing these problems. First, the scope has been underestimated due to inadequate understanding and problem analysis. Further, the international political system has not properly adapted to the global environment of today [2]. 
 Origins and Development 
 The GCF was founded by Laszlo Szombatfalvy in 2012 to address some of the largest problems facing our quickly changing and growing world. As the standard of living improves, so has life expectancy and with technological advances society has globalized, both economically and culturally [2]. While there are many benefits with these developments, there are also new, unique, and growing problems and risks. The GCF set out to research and identify some of the largest risks threatening the global population. The foundation is young and continually implementing new, unique methods for addressing these issues. See the sections below for how they disseminate their findings and what projects they have invested in. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 The GCF is organized with a fairly traditional corporate, organizational structure made up of a board, executive team, and secretariat. Founder, Laszlo Szombatfalvy, serves as the chairman of the board along with 7 other board members [1]. The secretariat is made up of 15 employees with Fredrik Karlsson leading the team as Executive Director [1]. The executive team is a cross section of leaders from the board and the secretariat [1]. These groups work together to compile research and data to determine goals and projects for the organization. Participants vary based on project, more information can be found below for how the organization recruits through third party partnerships for events, research funding awards, and surveys. 
 The majority of funding comes from donations made by Szombatfalvy as the founder of the organization. The funds are put toward a variety of research initiatives completed by the GCF, as well as, in the form of grants designated to other qualified groups [1]. See the major projects and events section for more information on the ways funding is managed and dispersed by the foundation. 
 Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 The GCF does continual research to determine the global catastrophic risks and analyze what is being done and should be done in the future to address these risks more effectively. Their global reach finds partnerships with governments and institutions around the world. They provide annual and quarterly reports with their findings. To see individual reports, follow the links in publications below. 
 The GCF conducts risk surveys with respondents from around the world¾through partnerships with local market research and survey companies¾to determine people’s attitudes toward global catastrophic risks and governance [1]. These surveys help to determine the extent to which global attitudes reflect the severity of the risks to help the GCF better identify gaps in understanding, global needs, and impacts of current initiatives. To date, these surveys have been conducted in 2014, 2017, and 2018, to access the surveys use the links below.

 2014:  https://globalchallenges.org/en/our-work/risk-survey/pulse-of-international-sentiment  
 Major Projects and Events The New Shape ProcessThe New Shape Prize was an open call from the GCF to find new models of global cooperation to address the rising global risks the GCF has identified. The submission closed in September 2017 and received over 2,702 entries from 122 countries. The submissions were discussed during the New Shape Forum and the top three finalists were each awarded $600,000 toward their work [1]. 
 The New Shape Forum brought together policy-makers, academics, and others in global governance for workshops and discussions that examine the future of global governance. The forum looked at ideas from the New Shape Prize to improve upon and explore the viability of these proposals to make a difference. Each of the top ideas was presented and followed up with workshops for further exploration [1]. For more information about the top projects follow the links below:

Global Challenges at the Stockholm School of EconomicsThis partnership with the school of economics added curriculum programs that study global risks [3]. The goal of this partnership is to give future leaders fundamental insights into these threats to understand how to create better collaboration with economic development to alleviate these risks. This program is planned for a minimum of ten years, starting in 2016 to include approximately 3,000 students [1]. Earth StatementThe GCF has partnered with the Earth League to create the Earth Statement to address the current state of climate change [4]. The statement provides a list of 8 essential elements toward climate action that world leaders can help to address. The Earth League is still in the process of fully analyzing and making a final statement on the matter [1, 4].

Case presentations were made by authors and community leaders followed by facilitated discussions among participants. A  panel discussion  of citizen-led sustainable change featured several leaders in the field and forum participants were drawn from development practitioners, researchers, policymakers and funders. Thematic discussion groups explored various themes, such as the use of culture as an asset for change and the kind of wealth needed for sustainable development. The innovations marketplace was a networking event, providing attendees with the opportunity to share and learn from community-development experiences. The final plenary was focused on translating learning into action, encouraging participants to reflect on the new knowledge and perspectives offered through the conference, and how they can be applied to their own initiatives.

You can help Participedia by adding to it.Mission and Purpose 
 Existing at the intersection of art, design and scientific inquiry, the Studio for Extensive Aesthetics (SEA) has been called an artistic research lab, pursuing a multifaceted approach which incorporates traditional scholarly research in collaboration with leading scientists, and artistic works in collaboration with industry, civic organizations, and cultural institutions. The SEA’s goal is to produce art works and research that sparks dialogue about the role of data aesthetics in contemporary culture, rewriting information culture as a collaborative affair. [1]Origins and Development 
 The SEA was established by Amber Frid-Jimenez in 2014 after she was awarded Canada Research Cain in art and design technology. [2]Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 The SEA is directed by Amber Frid-Jimenez, Canada Research Chair in Art, Design and Technology and was founded in 2014 at Emily Carr University of Art and Design. The SEA is funded by the Canada Research Chair Programme, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the British Columbia Knowledge Development Fund and the UBC Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies. [3]Specializations, Methods and Tools 
 SEA takes a transdisciplinary approach to the cultural mechanics and aesthetics of the network and the data produced by it, using artistic and computational means to create experimental platforms, installations, and books. Themes explored through these projects range from the aesthetics and politics of artificial neural networks to feminist media theory. [4]  One area of particular focus is data visualization, described by Frid-Jimenez as “a fundamental tool in advanced societies, which rely on ever-increasing data flows since the transition to the digital era.” [5]  The studio connects student and faculty researchers with international theorists and practitioners through projects ranging from screen-based work to urban-scale installations. [6]The methodology of SEA combines making and theory. An iterative design process, work at the SEA begins moves from preliminary research, to the prototyping and public display of virtual platforms and physical artifacts, to the communication of research results [7]Major Projects and Events Know what projects or events this organization has lead or supported?

 Since its founding in 1924, the Maxwell School at Syracuse University's primary object has been ""to teach good citizenship — to cull from every source those principles, facts, and elements which, combined, make up our rights and duties and our value and distinctiveness as United States citizens"" and to ""train practitioners in public affairs —people who would immediately enter government careers and effect change.""[1] Maxwell believes a multi-disciplinary approach is needed to create innovate policy solutions to new challenges facing the modern world.[2] Maxwell's defining interest in demcratic citizenship is demonstrated through its signature Citizenship and Civic Engagement (CCE), a nationally unique interdisciplinary learning experience that allows students to contribute to the public good while preparing for careers in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors.[3] 
 Origins and Development 
 The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs opened on October 3, 1924 thanks to a $500,000 grant from Syracuse graduate George Holmes Maxwell.[4]

Maurice Young Centre for Applied Ethics (the Centre)'s mission is to advance research and teaching of applied ethics, conceived as the application of normative methods to core issues in science and technology ethics and policy, organizational ethics, animal welfare, health, the environment, and research ethics. The Centre aims to conduct world-class research in applied ethics and to educate the next generation of applied ethics researchers and practitioners. It has, in part, met the challenges of working in this field by successfully seeking funding for several major research programs and a growing number of graduate and post-doctoral students.[1]  Origins and Development  The Centre was created in 1993 with endowments by W. Maurice Young (LLD) and the Bentall Foundation. [2]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Centre’s affairs are managed by a Coordinating Committee representing faculty, students and research associates, chaired by the Director of the Centre.[3]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Centre approaches other UBC academic and research units from its position as an interdisciplinary academic centre, and from its mission to advance the research agenda of applied ethics. Its students are drawn from a number of departments and units—including Animal Welfare, the Institute for Resources, Environment, and Sustainability, Nursing and Philosophy—and their research and teaching/supervision focuses largely on Medical Genetics, Law, Political Science, Journalism, Forestry, Botany and Computing Sciences. These relationships and the products of their collaborations place the Centre at the forefront of the movement to create “transdisciplinary” research.[4]  Major Projects and EventsBuilding a GE3LS Architecture (2002-2010)Genomics opens up a universe of new possibilities, but also raises many ethical issues that require public debate and scrutiny given Canada’s cultural and regional diversity, and the way new genomic knowledge and applications tend to move societal narratives to new territory. Building a GE3LS Architecture (GE3LS Arc) project was a Genome BC-funded project focused on three primary areas of genome research: food (salmon genomics); Human health (privacy and the use of data banks and blood or tissue sample biobanks); and non-food (forestry genomics). Building on a previously funded project, Democracy, Ethics and Genomics: Consultation, Deliberation and Modelling, GE3LS Arc used consultation methods and computer-mediated technologies to develop an understanding of how people make decisions and their perspectives on genomics research and biotechnology related to human health, food and the environment. The project set out to answer three questions: What social norms do Canadians use to make judgements about genome research and applications (how do Canadians make moral decisions about a policy)? What are the leading moral perspectives on genomics (and what makes different judgements understandable)? And finally, what is the relevance for policy development and implementation (how are worldviews and norms incorporated into policy)? Through its various deliberative public engagements and research projects, the project helped to support dialogue among scientists, policy makers and the public and contributed to the creation of genome-related policy that accurately reflects and responds to public concerns.[5]  Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Please help usverify its content.Mission and Purpose  Ethelo takes the tried and true process of representative democracy and brings it into the 21st century by using a powerful algorithm to arrive at a solution that is optimized for success. It enables people to engage with each other on their own time and their own terms. Everyone’s input is considered and included in the final outcome.  Ethelo’s platform allows for real-time feedback and iterative processes that harness the power of collective wisdom for governance and group decisions. Broad consensus in the decision-making process leads to better execution and fewer roadblocks in the long run.  Origins and Development  Ethelo Decisions has its roots in PartyX, a nonpartisan activist group created to advance new ways of doing democracy using internet technology. Ethelo founder and CEO John Richardson created Party X after leaving Pivot Legal Society, which he also founded.  Richardson created Ethelo to develop technology that could advance the goals of PartyX. He saw the internet, specifically eDemocracy, as a way to increase participation in politics and other aspects of civic life. The Ethelo algorithm was developed by Richardson to enable fair outcomes in complex multi-stakeholder negotiations.  Ethelo’s first major use case was PartyX’s BC Mandate campaign, during British Columbia election in April 2013. Ethelo evaluated more than 200,000 combinations of policy positions to create a consistent platform that would receive the fairest distribution of support from voters across the political spectrum.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Ethelo is comprised of two entities: Ethelo Decisions - a technology company dedicated to helping organizations focus collective intelligence to make the best decisions more quickly - and Ethelo Democracy - a non-profit society dedicated to a more effective, citizen-engaged democracy. Ethelo Decisions undertakes commercial projects to fund the development of the Ethelo technology, which is provided to Ethelo Democracy and its partners for the cost of hardware.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Ethelo uses an algorithm to combine decision parameters such as options, issues, criteria, constraints, influence, and fairness from there build a space of potential outcomes that are are evaluated and ranked according to aggregated analysis of the participants. It finds outcomes with high average support and low variance in satisfaction among participants  Ethelo is an extension of morphological analysis. It is compatible with and a complement to processes such as conjoint analysis, the Monte Carlo Method and decision trees. It incorporates a novel approach to liquid democracy using trust networks  Ethelo was granted the U.S. patent for the underlying algorithms in 2017. Ethelo plans to release the algorithm under an Affero Copyleft GPL with a public Application Programming Interface.  Major Projects and Events  Ethelo’s largest client is the Canadian government, which uses the platform for making internal decisions, gathering constituent feedback, and assessing risk.  Other uses include:  In 2014, the South Surrey-White Rock electoral district in British Columbia used Ethelo to gather input from residents about how to make the community a better place to live.  The Springtide Collective 9 partnered with Ethelo in 2015 on the Make Democracy Better project, an effort to increase voter turnout and engagement in Nova Scotia.  In 2015, Canadian credit union Vancity used Ethelo to collect input on from its members about how to achieve social and economic goals.  Roslyn Fuller used Ethelo as part of her 2016 Irish General Election campaign. She ran a month long project to capture voter priorities in advance of the election  Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Please help us verify its content.Mission and Purpose 
 Involved's mission is to increase civic engagement by finding a way to reach the average citizen. Involved offers micro-polling software for government, allowing representatives to send out single question surveys through their mailing list, social media, and their app. Residents can respond in one click, leave private comments and share with friends and neighbors. The ease of use and focus on a single issue results in surveys with the potential to go viral. 
 Origins and Development 
 Involved was founded in February, 2017 by three seniors at Boston University. After graduating, Involved participated in the BU Summer Accelerator and ran a pilot program of their mobile app with four representatives from the Massachusetts State House. 
 Following the pilot program, Involved opened up to all Massachusetts municipalities and successfully raised $56,502 from a crowdfunding campaign. During this time, Involved was struggling to gain adoption for the mobile application and pivoted to include integrating directly with existing mailing lists and adding share functionality. This led to a breakthrough in adoption, response rates, and virality of questions. 
 Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding 
 Involved is run by co-founders Caleb McDermott and Jacob Dansey. 
 The organisation was awarded $11,000 prize money and grants from Boston University and has since sourced $56,502 through equity crowdfunding from friends and family on Netcapital.

 The first use of Involved was during the BU Summer Accelerator programme during which, the Involved mobile app was trialed with four representatives from the Massachusetts State House. 
 The second use of Involved came in February, 2018 after the company had officially launched. The Involved platform was  used by Newton city councilorEmily Norton to ask citizens their opinion on whether residents should be held responbsible for shoveling their sidewalks. After sending the question to her mailing list and socials, the question went viral and received over 500 responses and 50 comments in the first day. Engagement rates on the poll were 300% higher than alternative surveying methods.

Origins and Development  The Irish Parliament introduced and passed the Resolution Approving Establishment of the Citizens’ Assembly in July 2016 [4] and the body convened for the first time in October of the same year.[2]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Irish Citizens Assembly was established through Parliamentary (Dáil Éireann) Resolution as an independent body with a Government-appointed Chairperson. The rules and procedures of the Assembly written and agreed up by all 99 members and Chairperson during the inaugural meeting.[6]  The Assembly is funded through a public tendering process. According to the Assembly’s website, various tasks requiredfor the Assembly’s establishment and continued operation were posted to the ‘eTenders’ website. The following contracts were awarded:“RED C Research and Marketing Ltd were appointed on 22 August 2016 to  provide a representative sample of 99 members of the public and substitutes  for the Citizen's Assembly.  The Grand Hotel, Malahide, was selected as the  venue for the meetings of the Assembly.Richard Jolly TV Ltd/Switch New Media was selected to  provide the filming/live broadcasting and streaming of the Assembly’s meetings.Q4PR was selected to provide  media liaison services  for the Assembly.  Roomaxx Ltd was selected to provide  facilitation and note-taking services  for the Assembly.  Beatrice.ie Translation &amp; Tour Guiding Services was selected to  provide translation services  for the Assembly.” [5]Other expenses such as salaries, office administration, and the reimbursement of costs incurred while attending meetings are paid by the Government.[5]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The number and frequency of the Assembly's meetings on each topic is decided by the Chair and is subject to change seemingly at any time during the process although extensions are subject to approval by the Legislature. Decisions regarding the scheduling, number, and frequency of meetings and meeting events is dependent on several factors such as the availability of guests, the number of public submissions, and the time needed by Members to adequately deliberate and decide on the issue(s).[1] For example, alterations to the schedule were made in March 2017 because “the original schedule had only a four week break from the end of the [first topic] to the weekend on [the second] and then only 3 weeks between that and the [next], the Chair felt that such a relentless pace would be unfair on the members, unmanageable for the Secretariat and most importantly would not allow sufficient time to prepare for the other topics.”[1]  Major Projects and Events1st Sitting on the Eighth Amendment2nd Sitting on Rsponding to an Ageing PopulationAnalysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

 The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation's philanthropic approach flows directly from the ethos and values of their founders. They are committed to acting honestly and with integrity, in accordance with the law and the highest standards of practice, and to treating all those with whom they deal fairly and respectfully.[1] Their mission is to support efforts to advance education for all, preserve the environment, improve lives and livelihoods in developing countries, promote the health and economic well-being of women, support vibrant performing arts, strengthen Bay Area communities and make the philanthropy sector more effective.[2] 
 The Hewlett Foundation seeks to acheive their charitable goals by: Bringing about meaningful, socially beneficial change in the fields in which they work. 
 Pursue change by tackling defined problems in a pragmatic, nonpartisan manner. 
 Focus on outcomes in order to maximize the effectiveness of our support. 
 Remain committed to openness, transparency, and learning. 
 Work in a collaborative fashion based on mutual respect; treating grantees, co-funders, and other colleagues as partners in problem-solving 
 Promote the values and practice of diversity, equity, and inclusion in their workforce, culture, and grantmaking. 
 Approach their role in philanthropy and their tresponsibilities to society with humility and respect for others 
 Maintain a lean staff with considerable autonomy; a commitment to simple, flexible procedures; and a cooperative working relationship between the board, staff, and the president, who is the leader of the foundation[3] Origins and Development 
 The Hewlett Foundation was established in 1966 by William and Flora Hewlett who shared a deep, persistent and personal belief in a life of charity and philanthropy.  The Foundation was created to formalize their charitable impulses with a loose charter mandating only a “perpetual existence … as a charitable, religious, scientific, literary or educational foundation for the purpose of promoting the wellbeing of mankind.” 1966 to 1972 are termed the “living room years” of the foundation, when family members met at home and together decided how the Hewlett Foundation could do the most good. In 1972 sons William A. Hewlett and James S. Hewlett joined the board of directors and, in 1974 the foundation hired its first executive director, John May. Under May's direction, the Hewlett Foundation operated as a conservatively managed hybrid of family philanthropy and community trust, focussing on grantmaking through “networks” rather than “categories.” The establishment of David P. Gardner as president in 1993 marked a turning point. Gardner brought both breadth and focus to the programs during a period of rapid growth in the foundation’s assets, which increased to more than $2 billion, and annual grantmaking, which increased from $35 million in 1993 to $84 million in 1998. The foundation broadened its scope of funding, turning from environmental efforts mostly in California, to encompass the entire Western United States and Canada. The foundation also broadened its education funding to emphasize K-12 reform and developed a program on U.S.-Latin American relations. Larry Kramer became president in 2012 and, since that time,  he has sought to maintain continuity with the ethos of Bill and Flora Hewlett. Kramer describes the foundation's current strategy as ""an ongoing conversation with our past—looking at the problems Bill and Flora cared about and the reasons they cared about them, and reshaping our work to remain continuous with those values and concerns in changing circumstances.”[4]

It is with these values and with the experience accumulated in the years 4 years of facilitation and activities with communities and representation of civil society in governmental instances, that we propose a space for dialogue that responds to needs that so far have not been met, in the best of cases, or do not have the means to express themselves.  Encouraging spaces for discussion and access to popular, open and free tools for reporting, information and communication can help people to empower themselves and promote the exercise of citizenship from and to their territories as well as political spaces at the national and international levels.

We believe that be including citizens in the decision-making processes, cities and local governments can increase trust in governments and shape better policies.  Origins and Development  CitizenLab was created in 2015 and is located in Brussels. It has developed a citizen participation platform used by cities, governments and civil organisations which is used to collect and analyse citizen input.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  CitizenLab is a for-profit company based in Belgium. Cities, local government or civil organisations who use the platform purchase a yearly license.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Cities and governments can use the platform to consult citizens on a range of different topics. The platform combines a top down approach (with administrators posting projects that participants can vote for) with a bottom-up approach (citizens can submit ideas, comment on the proposals and debate with one-another).  Another important feature of the platform is its integrated data analysis capability. It has developed Natural Language Processing algorithms which can easily process thousands of unstructured, multi-lingual citizen input. Comments can be automatically classified, clustered and located on a map, making it easy for administrators to see at a glance what topics are being discussed on the platform and how this varies across a city or region.  Major Projects and Events  CitizenLab has worked with over 100 cities and governments, from small Belgian municipalities such as Arlon to major cities like Vancouver, CA.

AMAU actions include: organization of meetings; support to popular initiatives that mobilize small farmers from RMBH; diffusion of agricultural experiences. In addition, the articulation seeks to deepen the political debate on the countryside-city relationship and on the role of agroecology in the construction of a popular project mediated by discussion and participation in the elaboration of public policies and urban planning.Origins and DevelopmentThe AMAU was created in 2004 after the ""Dignity and Life Caravan - Food Security and Urban Agriculture - Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte"". The objective of the caravan was to identify and discuss experiences of urban agriculture and food security carried out by civil society in the state of Minas Gerais. This event arose from the creation of the Minas Gerais Forum on Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security (FMSANS) and the Minas Gerais State Council for Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security (CONSEA-MG) in 1999, which included the participation of the Interchange Network of Alternative Technologies - REDE (ORNELAS, 2017)Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe AMAU is structured through the following working commissions: agrobiodiversity; production, marketing and consumption; self-organization of women; and medicinal plants. Its meetings gathered several groups, networks, enterprises, research initiatives and university extension projects, community associations and social movements that presented demands such as: urban and agrarian reform, feminism, healthy food, solidarity based economy, among others. In addition, advisory organizations, researchers and students from different areas also participated (ALMEIDA, 2016).Specializations, Methods and Tools  The focus of this collective is to deepen the political debate on the countryside-city relationship and on the role of agroecology. It focuses on the construction of a popular project mediated by discussion and participation in the elaboration of public policies and urban planning. The main claims and demands are: access to land; access to natural resources; promotion of agroecological production; technical advice with agroecological, popular and gender focus; political training and technical training; outflow and commercialization of production; popular communication; studies and research on agroecology in RMBH; battle against mining; combating pesticides; support to the territorialization of experiences, considering the multiple functions of agriculture (AMAU, 2015).  Major Projects and EventsAmong the organized meetings, it is important to emphasize the celebration of the 10 years of AMAU, held between November 29 and 30, 2014, in the municipality of Mário Campos. From this meeting and the systematization carried out in partnership with AUÊ! - Group of Studies in Urban Agriculture (Institute of Geosciences of the Federal University of Minas Gerais) was collectively prepared a Political Charter that presents ""claims and proposals of actions defined by the AMAU that, besides contributing to the debates, can subsidize the formulation and implementation of programs and public policies aimed at the promotion of agroecology and the strengthening of family agriculture in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte."" (AMAU, 2015) The meetings and activities carried out by the AMAU allow the creation of dynamics for the exchange of knowledge and practices, and collective training among the people involved, especially for urban small farmers. In addition, in its political letter, drawn up after the 10-year meeting, the debate on the multiple functionalities of agroecology for public policies stands out:The various activities of agroecology permeate other sectors of society performing diverse functions. Among many other activities that generate food, labor and income, agriculture involves the reuse of waste in the production of natural fertilizers, gardening, pruning and urban cleaning, preservation of springs and PPAs, recovery of degraded areas and of areas at risk, the afforestation and permeability of the soil, living pharmacies(medicinal plants) and seedling nurseries, school and pedagogic gardens, raising animals such as chickens, quail, pigs, cattle and rabbits. In view of the importance of the social and environmental function of agricultural practices in the city and in the countryside, it is essential that public authorities support the advance and consolidation of agroecology experiences in the RMBH. Government, private sector and civil society must organize themselves to build public policies to support and promote the production and commercialization of agroecological foods (AMAU, 2015, p.20)The AMAU has a fundamental role in the process of characterization and mapping of the agriculture in the RMBH. In the year 2013, the articulation built a ""Declaration of Participation of the AMAU"" and a collaborative virtual platform to systematize and give visibility to the plural profile of its members and other agriculture-related initiatives. The characterization and mapping of agriculture inspired and guided the performance of AUÊ! - Studies in Urban Agriculture (IGC / UFMG) that continues with the collection of data so that one can understand who are the farmers in the RMBH, how they are organized, who represents them, where and how they produce. Thus, it is believed that it is possible to construct ways of guaranteeing the maintenance of the farmers in the region, either through public policies and urban planning (ORNELAS et al, 2017).Nowadays, AMAU has carried out agroecological workshops and meetings to strengthen its self-organization, such as the conversation circles, the construction of community agroforestry garden and an agroforestry task-force. Of particular note is the Agroecology in the Periphery project, of which AMAU is a partner, whose objective is to promote agroecology in communities located in the outskirts of the city, mainly in urban land occupations of RMBH. This project works through training workshops, joint efforts and exchanges focused on guaranteeing the right to sustainable cities.Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

To build a social movement to engage citizens and the political system in creating a democratic Canberra.  Origins and Development  The Canberra Alliance grew out of a series of “Kitchen Table Conversations” held in Canberra by SEE-Change in 2014 which identified many issues of concern to participants who believed they were being inadequately addressed by governments.  Issues included the high-speed rail link, food production, housing availability, fairer taxation, refugees, environmental regulation, overseas aid, public transport and climate change.  A common thread in conversations was the failure of government to protect the common good.  The Canberra Alliance was formed by some of the participants from these conversations, with the aim to develop strategies to make the views of members available to decision-makers, and bring the power of the people to bear on government decision making through various participatory and deliberative democracy methods.

Please help usverify its content.Mission and Purpose""ManaBalss"" (  My Voice)is a Latvian grassroots NGO creating tools for better civic participation in decision-making processes. Its flagship project is ManaBalss.lv - a public participation platform where Latvian citizens (age 16+) using strong authorization tools can submit and sign legislative initiatives to improve policy on the national and municipal level. Once 10’000 signatures are gathered online, the initiative is submitted to elected representatives for a hearing.Since 2011, from the 38 initiatives reaching the decision - a final vote in the legislator, 26 have been approved and have changed laws or normative acts. Additional 16 initiatives currently are in the review process in the parliament.Origins and Development  ManaBalss.lv, a social initiative framework similar to  Avaaz.org  and  Change.org , aims to let people bring their ideas into the agenda initiatives for parliaments or state institutions. It was launched in Latvia at the start of July, 2011. It stands out with its user-friendly interface and integrated functionality for all involved parties — the users, administrators and the target group (decision makers).  It started like a side project by a group of colleagues brainstorming about their country. They noticed that even though Latvians are considered to be politically very inactive and reluctant to engage with anything, they actually are the contrary – they have done the Baltic Way, the Latvian Song and Dance Festival every 4 years, and the annual Big Cleanup.[1][2] What is interesting, is that Latvians do all those things voluntarily, nobody is paid for them. So, the group of colleagues concluded that Latvians  are  a nation of active citizens after-all, but they are disenchanted with the political system and they feel that they have no say, no voice, and no power. That's how that group of colleagues thought up ManaBalss: its creation would let every individual and every organisation get heard, gather like-minded people, and show the public need to authorities and get their ideas done!  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingDuring the years operational costs of ManaBalss.lv have been covered by micro-donations, most commonly from 0.5 to 5 EUR. It is one of the drivers to promote active population engagement and high quality standards for the publications.Specializations, Methods and Tools  The organization's unique results are due to four basic principles that the ManaBalss.lv creators developed over a 12-month period of research and planning:Development of crowdsource initiatives  — Authors of new initiatives are given council by a network of voluntary experts.

We develop and disseminate good practices, create tools to simplify facilitation of social activities, conduct social research, we also train and develop educational materials.  Most of the projects and initiatives taken upon by the Shipyard Foundation concentrate in three areas:civic participation &amp; public engagement,  social innovations,  research &amp; consulting.Origins and Development  Shipyard Foundation was established in 2009 by the Foundation for Social and Economic Initiatives, the Polish-American Freedom Foundation and the Klon/Jawor Association.  For over 10 years, we have been creating and supporting effective solutions to social challenges, involving citizens in deciding on public matters and helping organizations and local governments to plan and implement social activities.  We develop and disseminate good practices, create tools to simplify facilitation of social activities, conduct social research, we also train and develop educational materials.  The effects of our activities are used by e.g.: seniors, students and teachers, citizens, activists and local government officials from all over Poland.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Shipyard Foundation is managed by 5 board members elected for a three-year term by the Council. The board members oversee the entirety of the organisation’s operation. The Council is composed of 8 people serving on a voluntary basis. Shipyard’s staff consists of 35 people and its work is supported by volunteers (about 25 people every year).  Major Projects and EventsParticipation Practitioners’ Fora (2014-)Since 2014 we have been organizing annual networking events, which gather over 200 people (civic participation practitioners) from different Polish and foreign cities. They are open to all who have knowledge and experience in the implementation of various participatory processes (or who want to gain and develop them).  By organizing Fora we want to enable participation practitioners to get to know other people dealing with this subject and create a space for the exchange of thoughts and experiences.  More:  https://partycypacjaobywatelska.pl/forum/Public hearings on the National Resilience and Recovery Plan (2021)At the beginning of 2021, in reaction to the way the Polish government conducted consultations on the so-called National Resilience and Recovery Plan, together with 1000 other organizations, we called for their extension and inclusion of civil society in the work on this document. Then, together with our key partner (National Federation of Polish NGOs), we persuaded the ministry responsible for the consultations to organize the largest series of public hearings in the history of Poland. There were a total of 11 public hearings on the National Resilience and Recovery Plan with over 460 speakers (from civil society, local governments, trade unions, companies etc.), watched by a total of over 20,000 people. The European Civic Forum awarded us the Civic Pride Award for initiating and organizing the hearings.Climate Assembly in Warsaw (2020)Together with two other NGOs from Warsaw (Field of Dialogue Foundation and Civis Polonus Foundation), we organized a citizens' assembly on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources (RES). Due to COVID, we conducted the whole process on-line.  90  randomly selected  residents of Warsaw took part in the assembly.  We invited them to 8 on-line meetings, 5 of them were obligatory. Others took place on weekdays evenings and were aimed at additional experts’ speeches, Q&amp;A sessions and technical issues. They learned about the  energy efficiency and RES usage and decided on what measures should be taken at the city level to increase them.Civic councils on education (2019)In 2019, when the outbreak of the greatest strike of teachers and education workers in the history of Poland happened, we launched a nationwide campaign of local civic councils, during which people could talk about the reasons for the strike and together reflect on what changes they expect in the Polish education system. From April to June 2019, 150 grass-root civic councils took place all over Poland. Approximately 4000 people (teachers, parents, students) took part in them.Citizens' Assembly in Lublin (2018)School Participatory Budgeting in Warsaw (2018)PublicationsWarsaw Climate Assembly reportSchool Participatory Budgeting GuidelinesCivic councils on education reportDirection: Citizens' Assembly.

Every member is the bearer of a particular gaze and perspective, bringing their own unique values, interests, and principles. This complexity often makes us feel helpless when bitter conflicts seem to trigger autonomously, grow rapidly, and become incurable. [1]  Thus, there is a great need for ways of meeting based on mutual recognition and respect; for decision-making and problem-solving methods that are at the same time constructive of common ground and capable of expanding everyone's choice and initiative. In other words, there is an urgent need for more facilitative leadership, capable of promoting more creativity and more dialogue. It is Ascolto Attivo's belief that a participatory planning and/or training experience has a positive outcome only when at least some of the participants feel they have acquired these skills and are able to practice them in their daily life, to improve them, and spread them. This is the mission and goal of Active Listening, the main criterion for self-evaluation of their interventions. [1]  Origins and Development  Ascolto Attivo Srl originated in 2008 on the initiative of Marianella Sclavi, a pioneer in Italy of the theories and techniques of Active Listening, Creative Conflict Management, Facilitation, and Participatory Planning. Along with Marianella Sclavi, Agnese Bertello and Stefania Lattuille are members of Ascolto Attivo.  Ascolto Attivo Srlhas designed and conducted some of the most important participatory planning paths implemented in Italy over the last few years,  contributing to disseminating good participatory practices in the country.

Among its mission, its valuesacceptance, open mindedness, collaboration and coordination.The organization is structured arounddiscussion, the documentation ofoutcomes,the diffusion of this documentation to other organizations, and working on projects that include and draw inspiration from horizontality.  Origins and Development  Following the 2010-2011 uprising, the leftist political militant, Gilbert Naccache, started a series of political debates with newly minted Tunisian citizens. These debates, held between 14 January 2011 and 20 March 2011, paved the way for the birth of a movement called “Le Manifeste de 20 Mars” when a group of citizens left Naccache’s audience and moved to the side of the debates to discuss the future of post-‘revolutionary’ Tunisia. The movement’s mission consisted of reflecting on the contours and directionality of Tunisia’s nascent democratic experiment, defining the main actors and their goals, and establishing a public debate over the writing of a civic constitution. A movement consisting of thousands of citizens participated in debates and conferences to “let us write our constitution,” as it was called, across the country, and most notably in Tunis, Sousse, Nabeul, Beja, Kairouan, Gabes, Sfax, Bizerte, and Djerba. The, later known as “Doustourna” (Destourna, 2015), culminated in the sit-ins of Mahdia (22-24 July 2011), which brought together around 350 citizens, associations, lawyers, and legal experts to draft a civic constitution that was later published for public consumption with the aim of garnering feedback and suggestions from a ‘bottom-up’ approach.  During these initial debates in Mahdia, a group of youth encountered a misunderstanding with the larger group that required some attention. “We were spontaneously put together as a small community of around 30 people sharing the same view about work/organization mechanisms and ways of expression. We had later given it the name ‘T7arek’” (Interview with Olfa Khaled).  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  As a horizontal organization, T7arek resists vertical power structures, However, in order to register the organization as a legal entity, assigning ‘roles’ was necessary. As Olfa Khaled noted: “At some point after the revolution, when social movements’ spontaneity ended, getting an official authorization became necessary. However, our organizational style was distinct from the government ready-made framework for associations. We needed to legitimize everything in order to provide a premise for our activities and avoid trouble. We created the association to facilitate our social activism…We did not find a legal framework which may legitimizeourpresence a sa social movementin the street.That was the reasonwhy we createdourassociation.  Tharek was officially registered as an association in the Official Journal of the Republic of Tunisia (JORT) on 19 June 2012. With the aforementioned stipulated, its official leadership positions are as follows:  1.President: Salah Jmour  2.Vice President: Amine Ben Salah  3.Treasurer: Oussama Abdeljaouad  4.Vice Treasurer: Haifa Jmour  T7arekis founded on a number of principles (anti-racism) and guidelines. Membership is open to all those who accept inclusivity. Furthermore, anyinformation and documentation that is relevant to horizontality must be equally shared and be madeaccessible to everyone.T7arek drew inspiration from and was in contact with international organizations who used horizontality as an organizing ethos, such as Podemos and Occupy. As one of the members of T7arek  put it:  “Horizontality functions like the body/heart mechanism does. The heart contains all the vital elements of the organization such as documentation, drafting/editing, finance, law and communication, while the body consists of what is functional/operational: different groups, whether cultural, artistic, environmental, etc. These [smaller] groups are completely independent and whenever they need help in a specific area then the role of the heart is to intervene and assist. They are autonomous to the point where if one group decides to function vertically internally, it is totally up to them to do so, and we don’t decide on how they should operate” (Personal interview with Olfa Khaled).  The central heart is therefore responsible for delegating responsibilities into smaller hearts [technical committees] of about 5 people, where each is responsible for overseeing specific tasks (financial, legal, communication, etc.). If one of these smaller committees expands in membership, then it is divided it into sub-committees, each working on a specific task. Each of these functions independently and once it fulfills its mission, it returns to the heart with the outcomes (propositions) and the final decision is presented to the body for approval. In the case of objections, convincing arguments premised on evidence and facts must be presented. “There is no “no” for the sake of objecting. At this level, the representative of the group (heart) who attended larger meeting (body) should go back to discussion with the group and come back with an alternative proposition. Each committee (heart) has a coordinator in addition to a general coordinator of the whole body. Once the body coordinator liaises with all the hearts’ coordinators and gathers all final-team propositions regarding a specific issue, a general decision should be either approved or rejected in a big assembly” (Ibid).  Thus, while decisions are takenhorizontally,functionally there is some modicum of verticality: a ‘leader du moment’ that is responsible for overseeing any given action by the committee. The leader, however, is only in her position temporarily. Leadership must also rotate frequently.  The movement wasinspired bylarge national and international social movements like Occupy and Podemos, and it draws inspiration from biology(i.e. how dolphinsfunction in their natural environment).  Specializations, Methods and Tools  T7arek passes their model of horizontalityto other Tunisian groups which worked on(informal) politics, art andcultural activities,intellectualproperty,andenvironmental issues(specifically issue of “gas de schiste”). Notably influences include  Manich Msema7  and Fech Nestanaou. The group also works oncultural andartistic projects in Franceas a continuation of what has been accomplished in T7arek, Tunis.

When a country is democratized, it typically starts out as a polyarchy, as it is the first stage of democratic development. A polyarchy allows a country’s political elites to continue to govern the country through political parties, albeit with greater democratic legitimacy due to universal suffrage. However, the political elites and their parties do not want to relinquish power and hand that over to the citizens, which is the hallmark of real democracy. Instead, they want to concentrate as much power as possible to themselves. The competition between the political elites, and the political parties they work through, therefore obstructs democratic development after the first polyarchic step. Since Folkstyret is a democratic party that acts as a direct channel between the citizens and the political power, the citizens themselves can, in general elections, decide how much direct influence they want and how much they want to delegate to the political elites and political parties. Citizens have the opportunity not only to distribute power between the various political elites but also to distribute power between the political elites and themselves. In practice it is a version of sortition within a Bicameral System where the citizens themselves regulate the balance of power between the sortition chamber and elected chamber. This makes democratic development possible beyond polyarchy. This allows for political decisions beyond the legitimacy of the polyarchy. Democracy can begin to grow in depth so that it concludes more in every society and is not limited to spreading across the surface of the planet.  Protect the existing democracy  The political power play between the various political elites means that the political parties, in their quest for power, can be attracted to acquire help from undemocratic parties. This gives undemocratic parties political influence. Democratic parties use their influence to dismantle democracy. Anyone who wants to get rid of the most basic and undeveloped form of democracy we have in Sweden (the polyachy) can do so in just a couple of years. First through a simple majority decision in the Riksdag (175 votes agains 174), then a quick extra election and a new vote in the Riksdag with the same result. Then democracy is gone. Since Folkstyret is the only party that, because of its own constitution, cannot contribute to abolishing any individual freedoms, Folkstyret is the only guarantor that democratic development will not continue backwards as it has done in the last decade. (Down 5% according to the Economists Democracy Index.)  Curb populism  Populism is growing in the gap that arises between citizens and political elites. The populist claims to be the sole interpreter of the will of the real people. Instead of giving voice to a silent majority, the populist almost always expresses the views of a very loud minority. With Folkstyret, the citizens, with every vote in Parliament, can see the opinions of their own representatives in all the social issues that is decided on. No populist can with any credibility claim that the people wants something else when everyone can see the actual result with their own eyes. This removes the basis of populism.  Let each new generation conquer democracy and make it their own  There is a wealth of democratic institutions, but the most important one is missing. The one who constantly includes the citizens in the political decisions and lets the citizens speak. It is through participation that each new generation can conquer democracy and make it their own. We are learning by doing. Every citizen learns how democracy works by being a part of it and it is through participation that each one of us can shape our own democratic values. Democracy must be reborn in every generation, education is its midwife and Folkstyret can be the institution that constitutes the maternity ward.

After organizing cleanups for several years they had come to realize that it is not enough to cleanup the country every year but it is also important to keep it clean.That meant changing waste management laws and that in turn meant going against powerful corporate interests of global utility companies and their lobby. So they came up with a system that would decentralise power. No center of power means noone to lobby. Or more precisely, if everyone has power, it means everyone has to be lobbied for a decision, but that makes it much more transparent and can be publicly countered.So they dreamt up an information system for making collaborative decisions, based on good arguments where everyone's word carried equal weight. Where votes could be delegated in swift and smart ways. A system that would decentralise power, taking it away from political parties and institutions and sharing it with all members of a community, city or country. That system came to be known as Toru (Pipeline in the beginning) and Citizen OS later.2013 -- Idea is born at the Let's Do It!

Instead of discussions being angry debates that entrench people into their positions, they want people to instinctively identify and explore all of the interests, and then collaboratively come up with solutions that best satisfy their interests.  Instead of governments being closed off to people, they want governments to receive information and instructions from people 24/7.  Instead of answering simplified questions on a form mailed by MPs, they want to harness the power of the Internet to enable people to participate in democracy to whatever extent they want, whenever they want.  Instead of voting for a representative for all issues once every 4 years, and maybe not getting the representative that we wanted, they want to establish a  liquid democracy  format so that people can freely choose who they delegate to, issue by issue, moment by moment.Origins and Development  In early October 2019, Blain Cellars endeavored to create a website to help people discuss issues in a different way. Cellars had been working with high conflict separated parents for 17 years, using interest based mediation and parenting coordination, discovering that people are not as polarized as it seems.

Major Projects and Events  On January 16, 2020 we realized that all of the changes we want to establish should be documented in a constitution, and that all the things that other people are clamouring for, should be documented in a constitution, AND that the people of Canada should write it themselves, not the politicians.  During the months of January, February, and March 2020, WTPofC will be focused on identifying the leadership candidates of the Conservative Party of Canada that are committed to transformative democratic reform, and if there is not enough support for this within the current members of the party, to gather together enough people that DO share this vision and are willing to spend $15 on a membership to make it happen, and then vote as a block to put in place a leader that will make their desired transformation of democracy happen.

A key belief of CityHive is that the youth have innovative energy that they would like to harness in order to combat the stated issues, raise awareness and allow young people to become engaged in a democratically political landscape.  This organisation envisions a city where youth actively partake directly in the planning and decision making processes that affect their city. By doing this, CityHive allows young people to feel empowered and involved, and gives them a sense of duty, thereby enabling them to have a direct impact on their city. All of this is ultimately designed to realise the vision of a 'sustainable, inclusive and liveable' Vancouver, somewhere youth will want to live and stay.[1]  Origins and Development  Veronica Bylicki and Tessica Truong, co-founders of CityHive, envisaged development of a symbiotic relationship between residents aged 16-30 and institutions to create a more sustainable and engaging relationship with the city. Tessica Truong was inspired to create CityHive due to reconstruction in her childhood residential neighborhood that made the area exclusive to a small community and closed off from non-residents.[2] Her concerns that the area's youth were not able to contribute to the planning and decision making processes inspired her to create a forum called 'Plan-it Earth'. She experimented with programs and initiatives to create a more inclusive city until she co-founded CityHive.[2]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  CityHive was co-founded and co-directed in 2017 by Veronica Bylicki and Tessica Truong. The reason for creating this organisation was to bridge the disparity between the youth and institutions in which they reside. This organisation receives a wide range funding from sponsors such as:City of Vancouver  Downtown Vancouver  Generation Squeeze  Real Estate Foundation (British Columbia)  Landlord BC  Landlord Registry (from Landlord BC)The exact amount of money donated is not stated. However, it is clear that CityHive has a healthy relationship with many organisations that sponsor it, allowing projects to be realised with the goal of Vancouver becoming a more democratic and inclusive city.MembershipOne of the driving forces of this organisation since its inception is called '30Network'. This is a public 'think-and-do-tank' for thirty civic-minded leaders under thirty who come together to learn about civic issues affecting Vancouver. Participants are selected after sending off a Civic Engagement form. Applicants are hand-picked from a range of social backgrounds and a diverse scope of experiences. Even though CityHive does not claim that the selected applicants are representative of Vancouver, it is clear that they value diversity and multiplicity amongst the chosen leaders, allowing the network to be more socially representative.  Participants for other events are sometimes selected by project leaders if they are presumed to be experts or advocates of a particular viewpoint, but otherwise are open to the public. Some projects such as 'Bring Your Own Suitcase' rely on migrants to show up.  Specializations, Methods and ToolsPublic engagement events  Debates and  deliberationCampaigningCivic EducationMajor Projects and Events  After being selected, the group of thirty applicants come together and discuss issues such as environmental/energy problems, homelessness, and education quality. They then consider ways to solve these issues by creating projects that are sponsored and funded to catalyse success.Ice Breakers- depolarising politicsThis project aims to foster dialogue between polarised groups in light-hearted and enjoyable social settings. This could be between, for example, drivers and cyclists or teachers and students.  It works by first selecting a polarising issue/topic that will spark deliberation and engagement amongst the public. Then, experts and advocates on each side of the debate are invited to speak at the events, allowing for a fairer representation of each viewpoint. The last stage opens the events to the public to gauge their thoughts, ideas, and viewpoints. Once everyone has gathered together, a team initiates dialogue by tweeting provocative or polarising viewpoints to encourage communication, whilst also being the ones to facilitate the conversation.  Other forms of Ice Breakers also are being carried out. One event saw a giant 'Jenga' game being played which let the public engage in differing opinions to depolarise motorists from cyclists. This allowed for groups to empathise with the struggles of a group with a differing view, bringing people together.MentAlly'MentAlly' is directed at the wider public and then the millennial generation in Vancouver who may have mental health issues or barriers preventing them from voting in elections. 'MentAlly' seeks to boost the confidence of these individuals and give them a sense of autonomy to enable them to vote in local, provincial or federal elections. Leaders who are working on this project planned to train volunteers and begin pre-voting services in the months of July, August and September of 2018. In the Month of October 2018, the team at MentAlly planned to hand out 'toolkits' to voting stations.[3] This project seeks to remove mental health as a barrier to political participation.Count Me InThe 'Count me In' project aims to boost civic engagement of people of the ages 24-35 who are reported to be the bracket of people with the lowest turnout in Canada. 'Count Me In' takes a newer approach by targeting people in their workplaces and third places to encourage them to participate in elections.  There are said to be three layers to this project. The first layer will be the ambassador team themselves who will be responsible for disseminating information to their friends and family, the immediate social circle around them. The second layer come from the people in those workplaces whilst the third layer comes into play by partnering with coffee shops or dining establishments.[4]  Public attention is grasped through items such as posters, banners or board signs displaying politically provocative slogans/messages to encourage and elicit political thought and therefore political engagement.[4] Texting services will also be used to remind and persuade people to vote, as most younger people nowadays are online and have mobile devices.Bring Your Own Suitcase (BYOS)Those in charge of this project looks at understanding, tolerance and acceptance of migrants in Vancouver. The 'Bring Your Own Suitcase' project is an interactive series of events where residents and migrants exchange a wealth of knowledge for mutual benefit. In these events, migrants bring an item which they first brought with them when arriving in Vancouver. Project leaders of BYOS suggest that here, community building achieved through storytelling.[5] In addition to this, it has been said that when you do not recognise the qualities and assets that people bring with them, it can make them feel alienated within the community that they are living in.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  CityHive was founded in 2017 and launched many projects which have changed and evolved over time to cover a wider range of issues. In 2017, projects looked dominantly on housing issues such as the barriers first-time renters face in Vancouver in 'Housed Up'. On the other hand, 'Empty Nests' looked at trying to promote healthy relationships between renters and rentees. Since then, CityHive has come to focus more on other social issues such as education, understanding of migrants and attempting to depolarise groups within society. This shows that CityHive is actively trying to address a multitude of issues that Vancouverites face.  Although CityHive, and more specifically, the '30Network' community has shown valiant efforts to increase the democratic inclusivity of Vancouver, there are still elements which could be improved.  Firstly, thirty people do not seem like a lot of people if CityHive is trying to be inclusive. There should be larger teams and more of them. This would allow for a greater participation and involvement of youths, working together simultaneously to create a more democratic Vancouver. There may also be some form of unconscious bias when selecting applicants since they are handpicked, which means that not all applicants have an equal chance of becoming part of the '30Network' initiative. As Keren and Teigen suggest, people often look at stereotypes and heuristics unknowingly because they are unable to analyse information completely.[6] These cognitive shortcuts, as described by Keren and Teigen mean that people often overlook information and come to premature conclusions.[6] This means that those who are picking candidates to join the '30Network' could unknowingly pass unfair and biased judgement on applicants due to gender or social background. It has also been said that people are swayed not only by negative but also positive stereotypes,[7] perhaps giving people unwarranted advantages.  Accessibility may also be an issue for people wanting to get involved. These events and programs not all over Vancouver and are limited to the city alone at best. This may prevent many people from getting involved with their projects and limiting the amount of exposure and popularity the non-profit organisation gets through 'word of mouth'. Because of this, it might not cater to sections of the Vancouver/ Canada that need to be encouraged the most to engage civically and participate politically. Therefore, it is likely that they are operating in areas where there are relatively high levels of civic engagement in the first place.  Despite funding from multiple organisations, with smaller projects still trying to raise upwards of $1000, and this may not be enough to expand initiatives across the city. Money is always an issue, especially for upcoming organisations like CityHive. The lack of funding or periods of lower donations from sponsors may halt the quality of projects and not allow for the best execution of programs designed to encourage people in civic engagement. If this is solved by cutting costs, people may ignore or dismiss projects if they are not seen as good quality. Funding may also be an issue since CityHive is a non-profit organisation, and a drop in funding may cripple the organisation.  Migrants may not feel comfortable out of fear of judgement, prejudice or discrimination. Despite projects such as 'Bring Your Own Suitcase' trying to abolish just that, it still may be hard for migrants to show up if they feel uncomfortable revealing themselves if they will be seen as others. This may especially be hard if they have already settled well into the community and have adopted the language, culture or tradition of Vancouver. As previously stated, migrants may be judged based on stereotypes or heuristics[6] and this may prevent real understanding between migrants and other members of the public.  People may be turned off from civic engagement due to texting services. It is clear that  texting (SMS)  is one of the main and most popular forms of communication in recent history. However, this has also increased the number of spam text messages. According to Nagwani, the majority of SMS text messages are now spam.[8] This means that people may be first be deterred from using text messaging services in the first place, but it could also mean that people get frustrated by constant text messages reminding them to vote. This frustration and annoyance could lead to the opposite effect of people not wanting to go and vote. In addition, it is very easy for text messages to be ignored from 'silent' functions on phones, especially if people are at work. Encouraging civic engagement via text messaging may also not work if people's devices are not in areas of sufficient signal. It is clear that texting services are dependent on a lot of factors and thus may not be the best method of trying to increase civic engagement.  There was little media coverage, but it was positive. Ducklow praises CityHive for empowering the youth and allowing them to engage in key decision making process in Vancouver.[9]  PublicationsDoes this organization publish reports, studies, or other media?

GPACE’s vision is to achieve “an environment where women, youth and children are empowered and participate in issues that affect them and are able to contribute positively to the socio-economic and political development of country.” GPACE strives to respond to these challenges through various projects, where voters are educated on their political rights and how they can hold leaders accountable.Origins and DevelopmentGPACE was founded in 2018 in response to the various challenges that inhibit its growth and implementation. According to Program Officer Kingsley Banda, voter apathy was, and continues to be one of these challenges. In discussing this issue, Mr. Banda stated that GPACE research found that many young people hold the perspective that “we don’t see the need in showing up [to elections], voting for someone who is not there for us, who actually prioritizes his special interests or political party interests at the expense of development initiatives.” Another major issue inhibiting youth participation is what Mr. Banda termed “the big man theory”. Explaining this, he stated that for young people, the expectation in Malawian society is that “whatever an elderly person has said, you cannot dispute that.” He elaborated, “Young people are just like objects. Things are being made for them, decisions are being made for them but they are not involved. They are not effectively participating. Where they have been involved, it’s like maybe they have just been invited to a meeting but they are not empowered to speak and they are not given affirmative actions to make sure that their views are aired out.” Through the implementation of projects to combat the aforementioned challenges, GPACE has successfully increased its membership.Organization Structure, Membership, and FundingGPACE has a overall staff of 21 people. It receives funding from multiple sources, including Unicef, Focusnet, and more.Specializations, Methods and ToolsTo achieve its goals, GPACE implements budget tracking/accountability clubs throughout the world in collaboration with member organizations in their respective countries. Created after the national elections of 2014, these projects were created so that youth can track the expenditure of government officials. As stated by Mr. Banda, “they should be able to track the utilization of the resources because that’s their money...not the government’s.” In order to select participants, GPACE and/or member organizations work with local chiefs to identify capable young people. After this, GPACE trains the young people in how to monitor government spending/budgeting, as well as provides the accountability clubs with the data they need to effectively monitor and evaluate civil sector employees. As Mr. Saka stated, “time and again we are at loggerheads with district councillors because we have presented out something which they have covered [up]...there’s a lot of financial mismanagement.” Regardless, positive changes have been seen as a result of these budget tracking/accountability clubs. For example, we have tried to create an interface or a forum where a member of parliament can meet the citizens and explain things as they are.”  GPACE also fulfills its role as a Secretariat for 1200 organizations across world by organizing an Annual Dissemination Conferences during which all member organizations gather to discuss past and future activities.Major projects and eventsGPACE implements projects in four programmatic areas: Governance and Human Rights, Climate Change and Environmental Management, Health, and Child/Youth Empowerment. For example, with funding from the FOCUSNET Fund), GPACE implements the Citizen AdvocacyProgram. Here, 37 (20 men and 17 women) from member organizations gained skills on how a citizen can effectively participate in district councils for one month, with the hope of empowering them to “effectively participate in local governance issues from the grassroots level.” Mr. Banda proudly stated that, although it was difficult to establish due to government skepticism, “it was the first of its kind in Malawi”. Mr. Banda believed it was of critical importance due to his belief that “part of empowerment is that these young people should be aware of local governance structures, their laws and the processes and the systems”.

The movement employs multiple methods of deliberation and engagement, including activism that takes place primarily online, to offline protesting, community organizing, andpromoting political participation to realize racial justice  .Origins and DevelopmentIssues of violence toward young Black men and institutional racism within the United States’ criminal justice system were heightened with the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old African American, and the subsequent acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watchcoordinator for his gated community who fatally shot Martin while the young man was visiting his relatives  . News of the event and the people involved circulated quickly online, fueling community tensions and leading to widespread protests and accusations that the United States’ criminal justice system is fundamentally biased against people of color, especially Black males [1].Outraged at Zimmerman's 2013 acquittal of Martin's death, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi created the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag across online social networks. Remaining largely unnoticed for several months, the hashtag was finally taken up by millions of Internet users as the murders of unarmed African Americans continued. What began as a hashtag soon grew to a broader movement—first, in the United States and then internationally. In 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement—now distinct from the hashtag—initiated an urgent, national call to action and dialogue on the issue of police killings of unarmed African American youth. BLM broke into the mainstream, gaining millions of supporters and followers internationally after the 2014 killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson sparked reported civil unrest in Ferguson, Missouri [2].Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Black Lives Matter is not a centralized organization, but describes itself as a collective and a global network [3]. Officially, the movement is registered as the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc. Some confusion occurred in 2020 when the  BLM movement was conflated with the Black Lives Matter Foundation, an entirely separate and unconnected charity in the US .  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Black Lives Matter primarily utilizes  social media  and  protests , as well as lobbying,  petitioning , and awareness raising around police brutality, systemic racism, and racial disparities.

[1]  The association's projects are implemented through a range of activities, including public debates and meetings. Their citizen participation projects rely on a spectrum of methods, such as facilitated working groups, sociological  surveys , and polls. As part of the project implementation, Agora CE transfers ""knowledge and experience to their partners (towns or NGOs), enabling them to carry on without Agora CE's direct involvement."" The Association organises professional seminars, training, and conferences for their partners, in addition to providing consultations to interested parties. [1]  Origins and Development  Agora Central Europe (Agora CE) is a civic association, which was ""founded in 1998 with the aim of helping to enhance communication between local governments, central government bodies and citizens."" As part of this effort, the Association ""pursues consulting, advisory, educational, moderating and other activities,"" publishing materials about its work and organizing public meetings,  workshops , and social and cultural events, particularly with youth. [1]  Agora CE ""has been active in the Czech Republic for over ten years,"" aiming to promote democratization, in part by improving the dialogue between the central government, local government, and the public at large. [1] Many local authorities struggle with a lack of interest in public affairs from local residents. A similar issue often plagues public offices. For instance,  ""the local planning department would like to know what people think about the latest changes to the zoning plan, but only those residents whose land is to be taken up by the new road show up; or the local council decides to invest a large sum of money into renewal of a housing estate or into revamping the town square, but the people look on with disinterest or protest against the development – the local authority is about to make an investment and is not sure whether people actually want it or whether they will rebel against it."" [1]  Situations such as these are where Agora comes in, having dealt with those and many other situations in the past, helping to resolve them. They ""draw on the experience of the Netherlands which shows that the space for our engagement will be opening up even more – as the number of active citizens who are interested in being a part of the transformation of their town or village increases."" [1]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Agora CE is a non-profit, non-governmental organization founded under Czech law as public benefit company, with founding documents available on their web page.  Director and co-founder, Ivana Bursikova, named by the Managing Board, is in charge of the organization. Agora CE has no members beyond the Managing Board and Supervisory Board, which guarantees the transparency and legality of the organization's operations, its funding and non-profit nature.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Agora CE creates, coordinates, and implements specific projects of citizen participation in decision-making in towns and regions according to their Methodology of Seven Steps. [2]  They ""hold, organise and steer public debates, meetings, and discussions on specific issues of municipal development."" [1] The Association also organizes public inquiries and  surveys , via telephone interviews or opinion polls, before processing their outcomes.  Furthermore, they support the municipalities in their  participatory budgeting  according to their Methodology. [3]Agora CE also runs a student debate competition known as ""Students' Agora"" using their methodology  [4]  annually from 2005. For more information, please see the  website, in Czech .  In addition to the local level, Agora CE facilitates working group meetings and  workshops  at the national level, along with seminars on citizen participation in decision-making. Relatedly, Agora CE holds ""expert training courses on the use of new methods of communication with citizens in the segment of public administration.""

The GIGA is committed to a global approach to scholarship, which works with perspectives, concepts, and experiences from different world regions. The institute is dedicated to providing policy advice based on high-quality research. With this mandate — its research and knowledge transfer — the GIGA aims to achieve both academic and societal impact. [1]  As a member of the Leibniz Association, it follows the Leibniz dictum of  “ theoria cum praxi .”  Through their research, GIGA scholars identify trends early and provide strategic analyses, giving political and social debates important impetus. The GIGA advises decision makers in politics, business, and the media. As part of the Accountability and Participation Research Programme, the GIGA engages in the debate of the challenges for the participation of young people in across the globe. [2]  Origins and Development  The GIGA builds on a rich history of over 50 years of research on Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Middle East related issues. A centre of scientific excellence, the GIGA emerged in 2006 after the restructuring of the German Overseas Institute, which was founded in 1964. With its long-standing record as a source of world-class social science research, and its hosting of the largest non-university information centre for Area Studies and Comparative Area Studies in Germany, it is a trusted organisation among institutions and partners in Hamburg, in Germany, and within the international scientific community. [3]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The GIGA carries out  research  on four world regions: Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Under the umbrella of the GIGA, scholars conduct research in four regional institutes on the relevant developments on the ground and participate in at least one of four research areas:Accountability and Participation  Peace and Security  Growth and Development  Power and Ideas [4]The GIGA is jointly funded by the German Federal Foreign Office, the Hamburg Ministry of Science, Research and Equalities, and the other federal states. [5]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The world is in a state of transition. Economies and societies around the globe are becoming increasingly interdependent; rising powers such as China and India are exerting growing influence; and while new opportunities are arising, new forms of terrorism, violence, and conflict are also emerging. Building on its reputation as one of the leading research institutes for Area Studies and Comparative Area Studies, the GIGA is committed to using academic rigor to help make sense of the increasingly complex world situation. [6]  GIGA researchers are sought-after experts among decision makers in politics, business, and civil society, as well as among media representatives and other stakeholders. Research-based policy advice and knowledge transfer to the wider public are essential elements of their mandate. Thus, not only are GIGA research findings published in top peer-reviewed academic journals and prestigious university publishing houses, but outreach activities also include three well-established publication series and impactful public and exclusive events. [7]  Major Projects and Events  The project “  Democracy and Games: Analog and Digital Game-based Learning Tools for Youth Work  ” (DEMOGAMES) aims to contribute to this task through the provision of game-based learning tools for  democratic education  in youth work. The DEMOGAMES project is part of the Strategic Partnership for KA2 — Cooperation for Innovation and the Exchange of Good Practices supported by the Erasmus+ Youth in Action program 2019 of the  European Commission . [8]  GIGA Lead Researcher Prof. Dr. Sabine Kurtenbach conducted a series of research projects on Youth participation in violent contexts between 2014 and 2017 named “ Against all Odds - Youth in Post-War Societies ”.

RSF offers investing, lending, and giving services to individuals and enterprises committed to improving society and the environment. The example of RSF provides valuable lessons of how to facilitate meaningful and direct relationships across sectors and among diverse stakeholders within a structure of disciplined investment practice. It is unique in that it holds quarterly pricing meetings for its borrowers and investors to discuss and influence interest and spread rates, rather than use the commonly-accepted LIBOR rates. Together the group gains insight into each other’s financial needs, priorities, and plans.  RSF has a clearly defined set of values that emphasize trust and listening to understand investor and investee needs. Participation is carried out mostly through two mechanisms: community pricing meetings and shared gifting circles, which are both characterized by joint deliberation and decision-making. There is a sense that all affected voices are heard and that there is space for informed decision-making.  Origins and Development  RSF Social Finance has its beginnings in 1936 as the Rudolf Steiner Foundation, Inc., established “primarily for the furtherance of the interests of the cause and teachings” of Rudolf Steiner. From 1936 to 1983, RSF engaged in fundraising and charitable giving to organisations and initiatives arising directly out of Steiner’s work and lectures. In 1983, Siegfried Finser (a trustee of the Foundation) began discussing with colleague John Alexandra ways to work with money that were more consistent with the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner. These conversations led to the emergence of RSF’s lending program in 1984. That year, the foundation received a request for a loan to rebuild the Pine Hill Waldorf School in New Hampshire, which was destroyed by a fire the previous year. When the request was made, RSF only had USD 6,000cash in assets. However, they reached out to the community – who had incentive to see the school rebuilt – to fundraise and were able to make their first loan commitment of USD 500,000. This experience demonstrated the importance of community trust to RSF and its role in lending activities.  Following their success with the Waldorf school, RSF’s donor advised fund (DAF) activities started in 1985 and have been growing since to meet the needs of investors and borrowers. In 2005, RSF was among the first to launch mission-aligned DAFs, allowing assets held in DAFs to be invested for social and environmental benefit. RSF has also moved to work with for-profit institutions. In 2008, RSF launched the Mezzanine Fund, which was the first fund to provide mission-aligned financing (from accredited investors) for early-stage social enterprises. The following year, RSF stopped using LIBOR to set interest rates and launched RSF Prime, a community-based model for determining interest rates based on Quarterly Pricing Meetings (QPM) between investors, borrowers, and RSF. Finally, in 2010, after evidencing the lack of transparency in the dysfunctional financial sector, RSF divested from all public equities and redirected capital to investments more closely aligned with its values.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  RSF currently has seven 100%-owned affiliates: three non-profit and four for-profit. This mixture of entities allows RSF to differentiate between different uses of capital and match the motivations of donors and investors with the use of funds for investees and grantees. Two of the seven entities make up RSF’s social enterprise lending program: RSF Social Investment Fund, Inc. (SIF) and RSF Social Enterprise, Inc (SEI). SIF originates and manages non-profit social enterprise loans and SEI originates and manages for-profit social enterprise loans.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  RSF achieves impact in part by funding social enterprises that face challenges in raising capital from conventional funders. These include social enterprises that choose to remain rooted in a particular community and offer an inspiration for others rather than pursuing scale in their own operations, or those which need a much longer time to build a sustainable supply chain, or which face various forms of unconscious bias, related to gender or race, for example. These are highly innovative enterprises that challenge the status quo but are often dismissed as “unbankable”. RSF’s lending structure is centered on building community and generating a viable alternative to the complexity and opacity in the current banking system by providing direct, long-term loans based on personal relationships. RSF’s loan instrument may be the only one in the world that allows investors and borrowers to influence interest rates based on input from quarterly face-to-face pricing meetings (QPMs).  Major Projects and Events  RSF’s first QPM was held in September 2009. QPMs give borrowers and investors an opportunity to discuss and influence interest rates and spread rates by sharing their motivations, needs, and priorities. Beyond bringing borrowers and investors together, QPMs give borrowers the opportunity to consider the value of their loan in a different way. It is not just a question of getting the best rate, but also about identifying the best long-term partner that can help take them where they want to go, as well as the value of the community that RSF attracts. According to those involved in QPMs:  RSF’s purpose to transform the way the world works with money is exemplified in the engaged process we call pricing meetings. We cannot imagine a more direct, transparent, and personal way to work with interest rates. Though the system may not be perfect for everyone. – John Bloom, Senior Director of Organizational Culture [1].  When we had the last pricing meeting, I was taken by how much we were aligned. Rationally I know we’re aligned. But when you sit in a room and really hear everyone’s story, it takes everyone out of a box and brings everyone in the full human view of who they are. But we have a range we can work with. And when I’m really connected to someone or something, then I want to give more to it. I want to give more to this kind of process because it’s something I believe in. – Chris Mann, Guayaki Sustainable Forest Products [2].  In the case of shared gifting, RSF gives distribution and allocation authority to the recipients of gift money. By shifting the control of grant funds from donors to organisations, trust, accountability, reciprocity and relationships are created in a way that moves beyond traditional philanthropic models. There are no directed outcomes or objectives for how the recipients use the money; instead, the group uses its collaborative knowledge to determine the best use of the funds. Ultimately, the community decides how community wealth is distributed. RSF’s model also allows recipients to create mutually beneficial collaborations which are rare in standard competitive models. Grantees have responded optimistically:  When you take an egalitarian approach to the sharing of resources, seemingly insurmountable problems become doable. – Curtis Flemming of the Fresh Life Foundation [3].  It builds a culture of cooperation and spreading wealth rather than competition and a lack of transparency in philanthropy. – Haleh Zandi, Executive Director of Planting Justice [4].Analysis and Lessons Learned  Through formally embedding stakeholder alignment within deal structures, and combining different forms of investor capital, RSF’s lending program is magnifying the impacts of its borrowers by helping them collaborate with mission-aligned financial stakeholders. Since 1984, RSF has given out more than $285 million in loans and more than $100 million in grants. RSF’s loans through the SIF and SEI have maintained a 100% repayment rate of principal plus interest, which has allowed RSF to fund their operating costs on the difference between the interest rate the investee pays and the interest rate the investor receives. This also means that there is a low but consistent return for investors.  Publications  See Also  References  [1] Clark, C. and Soriano, J.

Thousand Currents emphasizes long-term funding relationships with effective grassroots organisations and social movements led by or serving women, youth, and indigenous peoples that work on the interdependent issues of food sovereignty, alternative economies and climate justice. The Buen Vivir Fund is based on the concept of buen vivir, or ‘right living’, which originates from indigenous peoples in Latin America. The term denotes a way of living that is in balance with the natural world, community, and generations past, present, and future.  Origins and Development  In 2015, Thousand Currents approached the former Buen Vivir Fund Director Joanna Levitt Cea about establishing an in-house impact investment fund. At the time of the initialconversations, a 2014 G8 report projected impact investments to surpass government overseas aid, estimating that more than US$400bn would be invested by 2020. Levitt Cea brought her experience of championing policies to ensure citizen participation and human rights safeguards at global financial institutions to Thousand Currents’ unique approach to grass-roots grantmaking.  Between October 2015 and January 2016, Levitt Cea conducted a landscape review of impact investing and baseline research, which included interviews with more than 40 actors in diverse realms of the impact investment space as well as Thousand Currents staff, board, and grantees. Thousand Currents determined that there were two major gaps in the field of impact investment in which their organisation was uniquely positioned to add value: the systemic lack of participation of the ‘beneficiaries’ of impact investment; and that, despite the rapidly growing diversity of entities seeking and receiving impact investment, the terms of this investment tend to remain strikingly unvaried. Thus, Thousand Currents decided to create an investment vehicle that would centre on the full participation of grass-roots organisations receiving investment capital and in doing so innovate investment terms and practices.  In May 2016, a draft proposal for the founding of the Buen Vivir Fund was circulated to select Thousand Currents donors, established grassroots partners, and advisers. In total, ten grassroots organisations were invited: nine established Thousand Currents partners and one new addition. These are: AFEDES: Women’s Association for the Development of Sacatepéquez (Guatemala); ISMUGUA: Institute for Overcoming Urban Poverty (Guatemala); GRAVIS: Center of People’s Science for Rural Development (India); CIELO: Federación Indígena Empresarial y Comunidades Locales de México (Mexico); DESMI: Social and Economic Development for Indigenous Mexicans (Mexico); EduPaz (Mexico); Ñepi Behña (Mexico); Women’s Awareness Center Nepal (Nepal); Ubunye Foundation (South Africa); and Whole World Women Association (South Africa).  In October 2016, 20 representatives from the ten participating grass-roots organisations joined eight investors, five advisers, and six Thousand Currents staff in Mexico City for the Buen Vivir Fund’s inaugural learning event. This event was structured as a five-day workshop to collaboratively spark the design of the Fund’s terms of investment, financial practices, and governance structure. After the Mexico City learning event, members of the Founding Circle opted into six sub-groups to develop the Buen Vivir Fund’s Guiding Framework. The Guiding Framework describes the Buen Vivir Fund’s strategic and operational goals and highlights those which deviate from conventional investment practices in five key areas: governance, risk, interest rates, returns, and impact.  In July 2017, the Guiding Framework was submitted for approval by the Founding Circle, from this point referred to as the Members Assembly, and enthusiastically approved by all members.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Buen Vivir Fund’s Members Assembly is the governing authority of the Fund, making decisions on Fund investments and direction. The Members’ Assembly is made up of one representative from each grass-roots and investor organisation. This governing body is supported by the Buen Vivir Fund Management Team, staffed by Thousand Currents, which implements the decisions of the Members Assembly and operates the Fund.  The due diligence process of the Buen Vivir Fund includes peer evaluation by Fund members. When a project is approved by the Members Assembly for investment by the Fund, this investment can include grant support, investment capital (to date, all investments have been in the form of debt), and ‘beyond-financial investment’, such as specific advising support that the project may be seeking. In the lending model of the Buen Vivir Fund, projects borrow and return 100 per cent of the principal received. Additionally, a solidarity contribution, referred to as an  aporte  payment, is made, over and above return of principal. Different from fixed interest payments, the amounts of these  aporte  payments are self-determined by organisations and made during or upon completion of successful projects.  The Buen Vivir Fund’s day-to-day operations are overseen by the Fund Management Team, which supports the Members’ Assembly and is comprised of two Thousand Currents staff, and two Buen Vivir Finance Fellows who provide support on operations and are supervised by the Fund’s Director. This team is responsible for managing the implementation of decisions made around the Fund such as deploying the capital for a loan awarded with terms specified by a Members Assembly vote. In addition, when the Members Assembly is preparing to make a decision, the Fund Management Team is responsible for bringing information, recommendations, and questions to the Members Assembly. This includes compiling information on Fund activity, progress, and learnings through biannual updates and annual reports.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Buen Vivir Fund draws from governance approaches used primarily by indigenous organisations in Latin America. Founding members from Mexico and Guatemala contributed significantly to envisioning and shaping the Fund’s governance model. The Members Assembly is comprised of one representative from each of the ten grassroots organisations, eight financial investor organisations, and one Thousand Currents representative. It follows a protocol for decision-making and collective reflection and requires a majority vote for all investment-related decisions within the Fund. Each member has equal voting rights in this decision-making process, which steers all decisions related to investment, strategy, membership, and conflict resolution. Examples of decisions made by the Members’ Assembly include the approval of new members (financial or grass-roots organisations) and the approval of terms under which capital is lent. Efforts are made for the Members’ Assembly to reach consensus, but membership is structured so the majority’s aggregate position is held by borrowing organisations. This is a structural manifestation of the commitment to participation. Issues are brought to the attention of the Members’ Assembly during two virtual meetings held per year and an in-person Learning Exchange held annually. In total, it is estimated that representatives commit ten hours per year to the Members’ Assembly, not including attending the annual four-day Learning Exchange in person.  The Buen Vivir Fund loan agreements are unique in that, while complying with regulations of the various countries in which the Fund operates, the agreements are not designed to be enforced in courts but specify that any disputes are to be resolved by the Members’ Assembly. For instance, if a borrower is unable to make an agreed-upon principal repayment, resolution takes place within the Members’ Assembly. First, the borrower is asked to describe in writing the reasons for an inability to repay. If the Members’ Assembly determines the borrower is acting in good faith according to the Fund’s guiding principles but, for example, due to conditions outside the borrower’s control repayment is not possible, two options are available. Either the borrower can create an updated, viable plan to complete principal repayment, which will be amended to the loan agreement; or the Members’ Assembly will forgo the loan in its entirety. If the Members’ Assembly decides the borrower is acting in bad faith to the Fund’s guiding principles, the Members’ Assembly collectively determines what penalty will be applied. To date, no conflicts that require such remedial action have arisen.  Major Projects and Events  At the end of 2018, the Buen Vivir Fund had made four loans with two in the immediate pipeline worth a total of US$465,000 to grass-roots partners in Latin America, Southern Africa, and South Asia. With US$1m committed, the Buen Vivir Fund expected to release the second tranche of capital in mid-2019. Examples of projects which are benefiting from these loans are varied and encompass a wide range of approaches that include:Strengthening and expanding markets for fair-trade cooperative suppliers in Mexico;  Building a medical clinic and training center to promote and preserve Mayan traditional medicine practices in Guatemala; and  Building affordable housing for migrant women and children in South Africa.In addition to loan disbursal, this pilot of a completely new practice of impact investment built collaboratively with grass-roots partners is an outcome in itself. The holistic and thorough nature of this endeavor cannot be overstated. From an application process which is peer reviewed, to an inclusive, democratic governing body, to a definition of returns that encompasses community wellbeing, the Buen Vivir Fund has brought transformative participation, in which people partake in decision-making, into impact investment.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The Buen Vivir Fund started small in terms of volume of capital, having raised US$1m in loan capital for its initial investment cycle of 2018–20. This US$1m, plus US$300,000 raised in grant capital, is being deployed with the guidance of the Fund’s Members Assembly. Over the first five years, the Buen Vivir Fund is poised to expand its membership to between 30 and 50 and increase its investments to US$5m. By the end of 2018, the Buen Vivir Fund was fully operational and had completed its first round of loan disbursal, linking US$427,700 in loan capital to US$113,000 of grant capital across nine projects led by grass-roots community organizations in Latin America, North America, Southern Africa, and South Asia.

EduPaz promotes agro-ecological practices that advance food sovereignty and improve community health.  Origins and Development  EduPaz has been a grass-roots partner of  Thousand Currents , receiving numerous grants, for over ten years and was invited to join the  Buen Vivir Fund  Founding Circle in mid-2016.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  In September 2018, EduPaz received US$90,000 in loan capital and US$15,000 in grant capital from the Buen Vivir Fund, the largest amount disbursed in the first round of lending. The loan terms decided upon by EduPaz and the Buen Vivir Fund include a three-year repayment plan, and the organisation anticipates contributing an aporte of 15 per cent. As a member of the Fund’s Founding Circle, EduPaz retains one seat on the Members Assembly governing body and has participated in all Members Assembly votes since the Fund’s founding, including the peer-review of another grass-roots organisation’s application.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Don Javier Inda, one of the founders of EduPaz, describes the values that underpin the work the organisation does:  Our main role is to accompany and advise in the journey of the groups with whom we work. It is [a] process of popular education: a shared and reflective practice among the participants; learning together in the process itself and walking together; supported by the collective wisdom of indigenous and peasant cultures; and a bet on their creativity and resilience. These are concepts and values we see as fundamental. The dominant economy is based on profit and seeks to commericalize everything. It creates greater inequality and poverty. Power and wealth are concentrated in smaller and smaller groups. Natural goods are exploited without measure, contaminating the earth, air and water, exhausting resources that belong to everyone, serving few and threatening the future of humanity and survival on the planet. In this context, we recognize the following as fundamental in our work:  Moving towards an economy centered on human needs and in harmony with nature is a vital and strategic option. Heal relationships between human groups, between men and women, between peoples and nature.  Development is not only economic, not just about producing and selling. Development must satisfy all basic human needs and meet ethical standards and values.  Value contributions of the grassroots groups: work, organization, knowledge, experience, decisions located in the specific context of each place and time, proximity that favors healing the earth and improving the environment.  The poor are agents with dignity and not objects of beneficence. With their work they are creators of wealth and have the right to all that is required for a good living: food, fair work, health, education, housing, rest, free and informed political participation.  Thousand Currents and the Buen Vivir Fund create a bridge between donors and grassroots groups with joint decisions, shared risks, non-extractive loans to grassroots groups, in a new experience that opens the way to an alternative economy.  Major Projects and Events  EduPaz is using the grant capital to incubate a community fund, A Helping Hand for the Ecology of Chiapas (Una Mano Amiga, UMA). The UMA fund will in turn use loan capital to seed the work of rural producers to create small enterprises. To date, 180,000 pesos have been disbursed to 241 community members involved with 82 projects to seed a wide range of small enterprises such as coffee and chicken cooperative businesses; mechanics and carpenters; and bakeries and grocery stores.

Rather than training workers for employment that doesn’t exist, it focuses on building a local economy by catalyzing new cooperative businesses. Examples include Evergreen Energy Solutions, Green City Growers and the Evergreen Cooperative Laundry.  The initiative thus starts by creating jobs, and then recruiting and training local residents to fill them. The model has been successful in creating new cooperatives, redirecting local profits to local communities, preventing outsourcing, giving ownership to employees, and further consolidating profits within the community .Origins and Development  The initiative was founded in 2008 by a group of local institutions including a local hospital, university and local government. It was developed as an alternative to trickle-down economics in the Cleveland area, by focusing on creating local jobs and worker-owned businesses rather than employee training [1].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The initiative consists of a specific organizational model made up of worker-owned cooperative businesses, including a laundry, green energy business and vegetable growers. All employees of these businesses are also part owners.  It is partly funded by a partnership between the local government, philanthropic community and university partners, known as the  Greater University Circle .  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Evergreen Cooperatives Initiative pioneered an approach now known as the Cleveland Model, which is a form of  cooperative management  that aims to implement cooperative principles at a larger scale than many traditional cooperatives [2].  Its associated businesses are all designed to be sustainable in both the economic and environmental sense, with the aim being to keep the profits, jobs and benefits of the businesses in the communities that need them [3].  Major Projects and Events  The main businesses of the Evergreen Cooperatives Initiative are:Evergreen Energy Solutions : provides green and energy saving services such as solar panelsEvergreen Cooperative Laundry : a commercial laundry service using environmentally friendly technologyGreen City Growers : producing lettuce, greens and herbsAnalysis and Lessons Learned  The initiative's approach has attracted significant accolades and media attention since it was launched [4]. It is particularly noteworthy because the Cleveland Model has scalability and replicability built into its design [5], with the hope being that the model could be implemented in other low-income, post-industrial communities in the US.  Whilst other initiatives have been launched around the country, it is worth noting that in Cleveland, a specific set of circumstances may have contributed to Evergreen's success there. In particular, the enthusiasm for alternatives to capitalism following the 2008 financial crisis, along with supportive allies and access to funds, enabled the initiative to start strong [6]. Nonetheless, Evergreen stands as a leader and inspiration for the cooperative economy in the United States.  Publications  See Also  References  [1] Evergeen Cooperatives Initiative (2020). About Us.

There are currently 27 groups in the US.Specializations, Methods and Tools  Local groups use a range of different approaches including public meetings, on-farm events, pitch fests, peer-to-peer loans, investment clubs and, most recently, nonprofit clubs making 0% loans [2].  Major Projects and Events  Slow Money clubs operate in diverse ways. One Colorado club,  2Forks , offers 0% loans to local farmers and food producers. Members make a small investment into a general pool of money, and then local producers propose their pitch at a club meeting, where members decide collaboratively and collectively how to allocate money based on how much impact the proposal will have on the local food economy. Repaid loans goes back into the general pool for redistribution. In many cases, recipients of loans also become investors in the club.2Forks also emphasizes the non-financial returns such as supporting young and local food entrepreneurs and enhancing the local food economy [3].

Following this, interest amongst the community grew and a credit union was established. As time went on, members became interested in the benefits of a cooperative beyond economic returns and pursued training and funding to become an established cooperative [1].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Funds are mobilized through members’ savings, and support KKR’s economic projects such as group insurance schemes, income generating activities, and community credit unions that provide financial services to members. KKR therefore links savers and borrowers in the same community. Members participate in the governance of the credit unions through the Area Committee and its sub committees, which meet on a monthly basis. At the annual General Meeting members have a chance to elect members of sub-committees and voice any concerns with the wider cooperative community.

Through public protests, the farmers gained rights to supply the Bombay Milk Scheme and formally registered as the Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union. Further successes include leasing of part of a government creamery, which secured market access, the lobbying of the government to limit butter imports so that the Union could supply the local market, and the development of other milk products under the “Amul” brand.In 1973, the Union joined with other cooperatives to form the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Limited (GCMMF), which inherited the Amul brand. Since 1940, dairy farmers have successfully negotiated so that they now receive over 70% of market price of dairy products.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Federation has received funding from multiple sources over the years, including Oxfam and the New Zealand government [1].  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The initial development of the unions and cooperative utilized  protests  and  strike action  and lobbying to apply pressure to apply pressure on the government for action, as well as the formation of  cooperatives  [2].

SCCWC child care centers are owned jointly by the care providers and the mothers of the children.  The SCCWCs are unique in the fact that they offer an integrated care approach so that children receive basic education and social skills, adequate nutrition, and health services.  Origins and DevelopmentKnow the events surrounding this organization’s development? Help uscomplete this section!Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) is a trade union in India representing women working primarily in the informal economy. It operates over 100 cooperatives in different sectors, including agriculture, savings and loans, and labor, of which the childcare cooperative is one [1].  The board of SCCWC is comprised of cooperative members and is elected every 3-5 years. The board manages activities and any issues that arise during the parent-teacher meetings or care provider meetings; ensures that financial regulations are observed; and sets nominal fees which parents pay each month, but operation costs are subsidized by SEWA, donors and local government.  Specializations, Methods and ToolsCooperative ManagementMajor Projects and EventsKnow what projects or events this organization has led or supported? Help uscomplete this section!Analysis and Lessons Learned  Enrolling their children at one of the SEWA centers enables women to work and has a positive impact on their income. In addition, enrollment results in reduced stress for mother and potential improvements in nutrition, education and overall health for their children [2].  The following excerpt is taken from  a report by the International Labor Organization  on childcare in the informal economy:  Sangini Child Care Workers’ Cooperative plays a larger role in the community in addition to providing child care. Child care workers are selected from the community and receive training before taking up their responsibilities. Training and skills upgrading take place every three months, and there is an in-house capacity building team that focuses on enhancing the skills of the  balsevikas . As a result, the child care workers are seen as leaders within their communities given their knowledge on children’s health, nutrition, social development and early education. The centers also serve as a public service access point for vaccinations, primary health care, and nutritional advice for parents. When women workers in the informal economy see that their children are well cared for this builds up trust and solidarity among SEWA members and commitment to the trade union and the associated cooperative model. Cooperative members also mobilize the community to demand improvements to the public ICDS and offers training to ICDS child care workers. The cooperative is a pivotal part of the social fabric of these dense urban communities and opens avenues for engaging with the local and national governments [2].

The statute of the association can be downloaded  here  (in German).A list of members and information about the current managing board and the auditor can be found online.[4]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  For Demokrative, democracy is seen as as topic, programme, and goal. The Association Demokrative promotes  civic education  and  democratic  citizenship.Civic education enables people to recognize and represent their interests, to participate in political processes and, in doing so, to meet their fellow human beings and their concerns with respect.  Demokrative promotes civic education by initiating and promoting educational offers for different target groups, by providing scientific support for civic education, and by networking and exchanging with actors from practice and science.[1]  Major Projects and Events  Core projects are the 'building blocks of democracy', which are instructor-led learning modules in which young people deal interactively with fundamental values and conflicting goals in democracy), projects in the area of game-based learning and the annually held Demokrative  round table . The Demokrative Round Table 2019 was held on the topic 'Chances and challenges of digitization for democracies'. About 25  workshops  of the building blocks of democracy program are held during one year with school classes. In the area of  game-based  learning, the project 'Let's play Democracy Barometer' resulted in free online print &amp; play material.[5] Also in the area of game based learning, the international cooperation project DEMOGAMES was started in 2019.[6]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  In its educational work, Demokrative emphasize interactive learning environments in which democratic processes can be experienced and democratic manners and participation can be practiced. In this understanding, the field of civic education overlaps with areas such as human rights education, the promotion of participation and the like.  It is important to Demokrative that educational formats are evaluated regularly, that these evaluations comply with social science standards and that the results of the evaluations are incorporated into the further development of the offerings.  Demokrative participates in exchanges between actors from the out-of-school and actors from the school sectors and in exchanges between actors and supporting organizations in areas whose topics and methods overlap with those of civic education. These include human rights education, the promotion of participation, tolerance training, projects that address democracy as a way of life and approaches from the field of peace-building.

Prior to this, tea laborers were poorly paid and the Kenyan tea market was dominated by multinational corporations with Kenyan producers having little control or participation.  Kenyan tea now commands a price premium compared to international competitors; it constitutes a major part of foreign exchange earnings; and 70% of the export value of tea is distributed to smallholders at the community level [1].  Origins and Development  Over the past 60 years, Kenya’s tea industry has transformed from large estates to smallholder farms. Smallholders pooled their resources through strong federated bodies to build economies of scale and succeed in competitive markets. They organised to analyse the value-chain; identified areas of perceived weakness; and addressed and rebranded their product in response. They were aided by a combination of new technology platforms, such as mobile money, and a supportive political environment—a nationalist government that halted the expansion of larger multinational players, creating space for the KDTA.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  KDTA is exclusively owned by 600,000 smallholder tea farmers from Kenya's tea growing counties [2].

It is no coincidence that the seat of the current School of Architecture, in use until the 1980s, was precisely that of the Academy itself in via Ricasoli, near Piazza San Marco.The university profile is outlined at the beginning of the last century when in 1907, in Florence, at the same location, a Special Architecture Course was established for the achievement of the diploma of professor of architectural design. In 1927-28 the Higher School of Architecture was established, promoted by local authorities to meet the cultural needs of Florence, a fully qualified seat for studies at a level more aimed at the profession of architect.Finally, in 1930, the course of study passed under the nascent Higher Institute of Architecture, with an autonomous organization and an organic study plan for the scientific-technical and historical-critical preparation of the student architects. Promoter of the initiative was Raffaello Brizzi, then president of the Tuscany Section of the Federation of Italian Architects and professor of architecture at the Academy.The Higher Institute of Architecture of Florence was governed by the Council composed of prof. Raffaello Brizzi, Director and Full Professor of &quot;Architectural Composition&quot;, by prof. Raffaello Fagnoni of &quot;Characters of buildings&quot; and by prof. Felice Jodi of “Construction Science”.Subsequently, with RD of 25 March 1936, the Higher Institute of Architecture was aggregated to the University of Architecture as a Faculty of Architecture of Florence, for the conduct of five-year courses and the achievement of the degree of doctor in architecture.Among the illustrious personalities who in the years that have made the history of the School of Architecture are remembered in various ways: Raffaello Brizzi (founder and dean from 1936-1944), Giovanni Michelucci (member of the Tuscan Group and dean of the Faculty in the period between 1944 and 1948), Piero Sanpaolesi (pivotal figure for the discipline of Architectural Restoration and headmaster from 1969 to 1971), Umberto Eco (internationally renowned intellectual and teacher in 1968). Numerous architects were trained at the School including: Andrea Branzi, Massimo Carmassi, David Fisher, Claudio Nardi, Adolfo Natalini, Renzo Piano (for a short period), David Palterer, Andrea Ponsi, Matteo Thun, Werner Tscholl.L.

Its aim is to build an alternative economic model.  To this end, it has set up a number of different economic activities  including an alternative social currency and community project [1].  Origins and Development  CIC was founded in 2010 by a group of activists. It has maintained an activist and revolutionary character, evidenced by its aims of economic transformation over reform or incremental changes. Its membership was increased through the  October 15 protests and occupations in Spain  against economic inequality [2].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  CIC operates through a series of committees with different areas of responsibility. Committees meet on a regular basis in assemblies to make collective decisions through consensus. This organizational structure is non-hierarchical.  Outside of the committees are additional members of the cooperative, including self-employed workers who can use the cooperative as a way of being self-employed without having to pay the large fee due to the state to register for tax purposes [3].  Specializations, Methods and Tools  CIC integrates economic alternatives, such as peer-to-peer exchange, social currency, protection of economic activity between the associate cooperatives, and reduction of individualized liability. Liability is reduced through the legal cooperative framework: individual debts of the members cannot be claimed from the cooperatives and the debts of the cooperative cannot be claimed from the members. Furthermore, the CIC has set up a series of entities, whose legal form allows its self-employed members to issue invoices, usually a process requiring a prohibitively expensive license.

Origins and Development  Established in December 2002 by the New Zealand Government in response to a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Genetic Modification, which found that NZ's policy making processes had missed the cultural, ethical and spiritual issues raised by modern biotechnologies such as genetic modification.Its Terms of Reference reflected global developments in science policy making including those contained in the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology (2000), which said that the culture of policymaking needed to change ‘so that it becomes normal to bring science and the public into dialogue about new developments at an early stage.’Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  An independent body that was free to set its own work programme within a Terms of Reference. Its 10-12 members were appointed by the Government not on the basis of expertise in bioethics, ethics or science but rather to ensure diversity of training, experience and background. The Council always had a significant Māori presence.  The Council was supported by a full time secretariat of 3-4 people and had an annual budget of NZ$1.5M.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The Council was a pioneer in the development and use of public engagement processes based on public dialogue and deliberation in both face-to-face and online contexts.  Major Projects and Events  The Council organised 2 nationwide public dialogue processes: one on 'Human genes in other organisms' (2004) and the other on 'Xenotransplantation: animal-to-human transplantation' (2005). It organised 1 nationwide public deliberation on 'Who gets born? Pre-birth testing' (2007-8).  It also did work on nanotechnology, human embryo research, issues of Māori tikanga ('the Māori way of doing things correctly'), and how to engage the public on complex science issues.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The Council engaged with thousands of New Zealanders in new ways. Independent evaluation showed that high levels of satisfaction with its processes, which it learned to make more relevant to policy makers. It contributed to the evidence base about engaging the public effectively on complex issues and showed that lay citizens can deliberate well online even on highly contested issues.Despite domestic and international recognition, the New Zealand Government never formally respond to any of its recommendations and Toi te Taiao: the Bioethics Council was disestablished in March 2009.

Origins and Development  DARE was officially launched on 28 June 2003 in Antwerp. It is a network of European providers of Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  DARE is registered under Belgian NPO law as a non-profit organisation (vereniging zonder winstoogmerk) and has its legal seat in Belgium. Its members represent organisations of different size and working in different fields of education in the fields democratic citizenship and human rights.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  We are a community of practice representing different approaches to education. DARE is engaged in:Exchange of information, contents, methods and staff;  Common programmes for education and qualification of staff, board members and volunteers in member organisations;  Advocacy for education for democratic citizenship and human rights at the Council of Europe and European Union;  Common educational projects, exchange on standards and good practice.Major Projects and Events  The annual General Assembly is the core of the membership networking. Furthermore, DARE provides trainings and is taking part in European projects. By 2020, DARE is participating in the following projects:Project: Unsung HeroesCompetendo – The Open Source Toolbox for Civic EducationProject DEMOGAMESProject EntreComp 360: Promoting Initiative and Engagement across SectorsProject: DIGIT-AL – Digital Transformation in Adult Learning for Active CitizenshipProject: Focus Group Competencies for Democratic CultureProject TEVIP: Transforming European Values into PracticeAnalysis and Lessons Learned  Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education are relevant for any social context, for any age group and in any region in Europe. Instead of dividing education and learning into sectors or age groups, we should seek cooperation between non-formal and formal education and also with civil society as the huge non-formal and informal learning and empowerment space for participation.  In times of transformation with a lot of complex social challenges and also threats for democracy inEurope, citizenship education and human rights education should be recognized in their systemic relevance and promoted as a learning field for the development of key competencies - knowledge, skills, attitudes and values.  Critical thinking, active participation, empowerment of indivduals and groups, learning about complex social, economic, ecologic and cultural topics, such as digital transformation, climate change, data-economy, global fairness, social inclusion, and others, require adequate new responses in education and cooperation.

The layout of the space meets several objectives:- remove dirt and danger;- use the space for urban agriculture and greening;- create beauty and link between neighbors, unite around a project and open it up to the city [i].The place bringing together permaculture mounds, rest areas and a street library has been appropriated by the neighborhood and activities are organized there to liven up the space. By meeting citizens around the space, exchanges are created within the district. The place thus occupies several functions: that of garden, of public place but also of concertation of the life of the district.Origins and developmentVacant lot: a public health problemThe Carré Casgrain land was originally a triplex that burned down a few years ago in Montreal, in the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough, and the private land has remained vacant since. Several citizen complaints concerning the cleanliness of the land have been filed with the City since the early 2000s.Creation of a green lane committee (2015-2016)In June 2015, a collective of citizens created a green lane committee between rue Bellechasse and rue Beaubien, adjoining the land. The green lane committees are citizen initiatives supported by the boroughs of the city of Montreal, so that residents of the neighborhood can appropriate the public space and more particularly, implement projects for greening the riparian strips of public roads. The borough of Rosemont-Petite-Patrie in which this project is taking place is the borough with the largest number of green alleys in Montreal in 2019 [ii].The procedures with the borough lead to an authorization granted at the beginning of 2016 and flower beds dug in the lane by the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough in October 2016. In parallel with these activities in the lane, the committee ruelle verte, now established, is regularly called upon by the residents of the district to invest the space of the vacant land, identified as a public health problem.First steps in the field (2016-2017)In the spring of 2016, a resident of the neighborhood approached the Green Lane Committee, motivated to invest the land and take care of it. A meeting is organized in the field, then workshops to create gardening tubs are conducted during the year. In the summer of 2017, a field cleaning operation is organized by the residents of the district, allowing the first season of square gardening. The green lane project therefore gained momentum when part of the committee decided to appropriate the vacant land adjacent to the lane. No official authorization has been requested from the landowner or the City for the occupation of the space. The development and greening of space positively modify the relationship of residents to vacant space [iii].Developments (2017-2020)The Casgrain square, a gardening spaceGardening is carried out in tubs, the first year, then on permaculture mounds in 2018 and finally in soil cultivation in 2019, following backfilling of the land. Landscaping was carried out in 2018, establishing cultivation spaces and facilities were installed on the ground: street library, table and benches, etc. In the philosophy of permaculture, ornamental plants and edible plants come together. Collective activities are organized and punctuate the year: from sowing, to planting and closing the garden. The place is seen as a space for urban agriculture within the district. The harvests and the space are accessible to everyone, gardener and passer-by. The group is organized in a flexible and horizontal way, with the participation of all depending on the wishes and availability. Since the space belongs to an owner, citizens of gardeners sometimes come up against issues linked to the occupation of the land.private property. Equipment is thus installed on the space by the owner or tenants, such as advertising panels or clothing recovery boxes. The latter hamper the practice of gardening and the collective mobilizes and calls on the public authorities to ensure their withdrawal. In 2019, in reaction to a land reserve status for end of park granted by the City, the owner of the land bulldozed the Casgrain square.b. The Casgrain square, a public square  [iv]The purpose of the Casgrain Square space is to foster social ties in the community. Exchanges are created between gardeners and passer-bys, but also between residents of the neighborhood. There are many examples of spontaneous occupation of space, from dinners to improvised parties or even work meetings. To promote the reappropriation of the public space by the residents of the district, activities are regularly organized at the square Casgrain.In 2017, musician jams are offered by an involved gardener, then many activities are organized in 2018. Improvised and spontaneous, the activities are mostly informal and involve a few participants in the project as well. only neighbors. Note in this regard the evening of Midsummer&#39;s Day which brings together residents and friends around a barbecue, but also an event of corn roast for example. In 2019, the cultural project is gaining momentum: many events are organized in the square. With the growing notoriety of the space, multiple event proposals are brought in by people outside the project. In 2019, the Casgrain square hosted concerts, a conference on zero waste, film screenings and a parade. These projects are often carried out in conjunction with community or cultural organizations.vs. Le Carré Casgrain, a citizens&#39; committee involved in city issuesThe square Casgrain being a private land occupied without the agreement of the owner, the collective must face issues of cohabitation on the land. In addition, a garage project for the Société de Transport de Montréal (STM) scheduled for 2021 threatens the brightness of the square and causes inconvenience related to the traffic of buses in the neighborhood. The collective is mobilizing in reaction to the site in 2018 with the City of Montreal. Steps are taken to try to guarantee the sustainability of the space by some members of the collective.Many local residents worried by the nuisance linked to the site appeal to the collective as an organ representing, despite itself, the district and as a privileged interlocutor of the public authorities. In fact, the collective was formed into a Citizens&#39; Committee of Bellechasse, to interact with the STM about the planned construction site adjacent to the Casgrain square [v]. This empty shell, useful for public letters and correspondence with official bodies, contributes to the organization of an information meeting in October 2018 with the residents concerned on the garage project in the neighborhood.Representation activities with municipal authorities are increasing in 2019 by a few citizens of the Casgrain square involved in a sub-group called Avenir du carré. Official bodies are called upon to ensure the sustainability of the space, which leads to a declaration of land reserve filed for the end of the park by the borough in April 2019 [vi]. Following this, the owner of the land proceeded with the destruction of the green space in October 2019 [vii].Organizational structure, membership and fundingOrganizational structureThe Casgrain square collective is an informal group open to everyone. The participation of all is welcome depending on availability, skills and desires. There is no obligation to take on tasks or attend a certain number of meetings. The group operates in a flexible and horizontal manner, around the operating principles of self-management. Thus, developments have been made according to the expertise of each member of the collective, and these developments in return generate the initiative of new participants [viii]. The visual image of the place was for example created thanks to the introduction of a graphic designer in the collective.If collective chores are organized, there is no obligation in the allocation of tasks within thegroup. The task management was initially done through a chain of emails and a monthly meeting under the chairmanship of the alley committee. Gradually, tasks are organized through digital management tools such as Google doc (for the watering calendar) or Slack which is gradually replacing monthly meetings. There are strong links between the members of the collective, who gather at the Cargrain Square as much for informal social activities as for the management of daily tasks.CollectiveThe collective is organized around a core of eight to ten people involved regularly, and about sixty people mobilized punctually during major chore-type events. To reach and mobilize residents for major events, leaflets are distributed to the neighborhood and events are created on Facebook through the “Carré et sa ruelle” page, used to raise awareness of the project and mobilize the community. community and archive the project history.Because of the squat status, the Casgrain square cannot officially seek subsidies or aid, hence the use of the green lane committee, recognized by the borough and the City, which adjoins the land. The links between the two projects are relatively strong and the members of the Green Lane committee participate more or less actively in the activities of the Casgrain square.Funding, donations and servicesUnder the umbrella of the alley committee, the Carré collects donations of compost, plants and bins from the borough, through municipal green lane support programs set up in collaboration with the Nature- organization. Action Quebec in Montreal. If the green lane committee is the official intermediary, the City nevertheless unofficially recognizes the Casgrain square and values the impacts of the project: the green lane committee obtained the first prize in the citizen innovation category as part of the green streets days of Montreal for the garden concept - public space open to all of the Carré Casgrain in September 2018.If the requests for funding from the borough or the City are not all accepted, the Carré Casgrain benefits from a network of donations of goods and services set up with local residents, community organizations and local businesses. Thus, construction and gardening equipment and plants are collected or donated, access to water and electricity are also offered by neighbors. The project budget is ultimately relatively low thanks to this recovery system in line with the philosophy of the project.Institutional issuesDue to the informal nature of the collective, the Casgrain square faces various challenges: a feeling of exhaustion due to the slowness of institutional relations, difficulty in entering into the framework of the funding programs offered, over-solicitation in an ecosystem where this type of project does not last long in the long term, acts of vandalism on the ground. However, these difficulties do not undermine the motivation of the collective and the recognition remains numerous. They demonstrate the legitimacy of the group, both institutional - in 2019, the City grants the Casgrain square land reserve status for the end of the park - and community - through discussions with citizens and organizations requesting the square for conferences or visits.Specializations, methods and toolsAs an informal and voluntary collective, the square Casgrain has not played a specific role of citizen participation since its creation. It rather acts as a citizen participation initiative as such, which is demonstrated in the appropriation and occupation of a vacant public space but also in the collective organization in self-management which is experienced on a daily basis. The square thus develops a deliberative space marked by the search for consensus and the empowerment of the citizens who take part in it, particularly in their relations with public authorities [ix].We can observe a process of citizen participation in practice through gardening activities but also through cultural events held in the Casgrain square. The approach is tested from the ideation and implementation of projects since the space is free to use by all those who wish it: decisions do not need to be validated unanimously by the  he group, although it is common to use meetings or collaborative management tools (Trello, Slack, Google doc, Facebook) to mention upcoming projects and solicit the involvement of the collective. Communication within the group is based on trust and benevolence in exchanges. Everyone is free to invest according to their possibilities and desires. Self-management over time promotes the multiplication of projects and their implementation in collaboration with a community and peer network.Regarding the methods of project implementation, let us mention a move towards cloud computing tools that reduce the frequency of meetings: previously monthly, meetings are now only held in the event of a crisis. Management is essentially carried out through the collaborative tool Slack allowing discussion channels to prioritize and organize conversations within the group according to the different projects. The participatory objective is also demonstrated in the attention to the inclusion of everything carried by the collective: thus, communication on social networks is coupled with communication by leaflet to reach populations who would not have access to the internet.In addition, the collective is also distinguished by the institutional relations supported with the borough and the City, with the objective of perpetuating the green space within the district. This approach creates a relay role for the information collected from local populations. Thus, the Bellechasse citizens&#39; committee was established, an empty shell that makes it possible to relay complaints from the community to competent authorities in the matter and to inform citizens in return of the responses obtained through a newsletter. In addition, the exchange maintained with municipal authorities helps to strengthen the legitimacy of the group, despite the illegal status of the occupation of the land. The granting of a reserve for the end of the park by the City makes it possible to see in the Casgrain square experience a form of institutionalization of the practice of greening vacant private land [x].Major projects and eventsInitiatives carried out: socialization activities and political mobilizations- Saint-Jean barbecue 2018: gathering of around thirty participants among the neighborhood around a potluck- Valentine&#39;s Day 2019: declaration of love squared manifested by poems on the advertising panels on the ground [xi]- Approaches to the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough to stabilize the presence and occupation of the collective on the Casgrain square: reserve for the end of the park granted in April 2019 by the City- Disappearance of the clothing recycling bins in the field following a complaint made by Carré Casgrain in the summer of 2019Supported initiatives: citizen mobilization at the neighborhood level- Citizen mobilization against the garage project of the Société de Transport de Montréal relayed on behalf of the Bellechasse citizens&#39; committee by the Carré CasgrainConsulting activities: permaculture, citizen initiatives and  placemaking- TD Park People Congress, which selects the Square for a visit as part of its pan-Canadian conference programming: visit by members of the collective in June 2019- 5à7 volunteering at the University of Quebec in Montreal: event presenting different volunteer initiatives, which asks the Square to promote the project in June 2019- Implementation of participatory citizen projects in living environments by the Montreal Ecology Center and the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough: conference on permaculture held by participants from the Casgrain square as part of the programming of the citizen project on the living environment.- Referencing of the Carré Casgrain within the framework of the Landes community organization&#39;s fact sheets on parks and citizen implications: selection from around twenty other projects chosen to equip citizens [xii]See as wellhttps://www.facebook.com/lecarreetsaruelle/References  -justify &quot;&gt;  Laurence Bherer, Pascale Dufour &amp; Françoise Montambeault (2016) The participatory democracy turn: an introduction, Journal of Civil Society, 12: 3, 225-230, DOI:10.1080 / 17448689.2016.1216383Annabelle Mazoyer (2018), “Sociological analysis of the emergence of the phenomenon of green alleys on the island of Montreal”, Mémoire, UQAM.Notes[i] Lande &amp; Solon, “Ecocitoyenne action laboratory”, June 2019, p.9.  https://landemtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lande_Solon_Labo_VF.pdf[ii]  https://faitescommechezvous.org/verdir/ruelles-vertes/[iii] Mazoyer Annabelle, Sociological analysis of the emergence of the phenomenon of green alleys on the island of Montreal, Mémoire, UQAM, November 2018, p. 82[iv] Lande &amp; Solon, “Ecocitoyenne action laboratory”, June 2019, p.9.  https://landemtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lande_Solon_Labo_VF.pdf[v] Colpron Suzanne, “A gigantic STM construction site is underway”,  La Presse,  April 11, 2019,  https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/grand-montreal/201904/10/01-5221716- a-gigantic-site-of-the-stm-is-starting-in-motion.php  .[vi] Delacour Emmanuel, “Carré Casgrain: a first step towards a park”,  Metro  , April 5, 2019.  https://journalmetro.com/local/villeray-st-michel-parc-extension/2303828/carre-casgrain- a-first-step-towards-a-park /[vii] Cyr Guillaume, “A community space razed by the landowner”,  TVA Nouvelles  , October 7, 2019.  https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2019/10/07/un-espace-communautaire-rase-par -the-land-owner[viii] Ibid. p. 109[ix] Bherer Laurence, Dufour Pascale and Montambeault Françoise, “The participatory democracy turn: an introduction”,  Journal of Civil Society  , 12: 3, 225-230.[x]  Ibid.[xi] Lasselin Camille, “When advertising harms beauty and citizen initiatives”,  HuffPost Québec Blogues  , February 15, 2019.  https://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/camille-lasselin/a  displays-publicite-nuit-  beaute- citizens-initiatives-carre-casgrain_a_23670646 /[xii] Lande &amp; Solon, “Ecocitoyenne action laboratory”, June 2019, p.9.  https://landemtl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lande_Solon_Labo_VF.pdf",1,0,0,1,0,,"The Carr  Casgrain, vacant lot at the end of a green alley in the Rosemont Petite Patrie borough in Montreal, is appropriated by a committee of residents from neighboring streets to meet up, garden together and organize events. ."

Its mission is defined as follows:- Sustain the Champ des Possibles as a public green space and an urban biodiversity reserve- Promote and encourage popular education in natural sciences, history and the arts- Promote the creation of new green spaces and urban biocorridors.Since 2010, the organization has been working with citizens and the borough to develop a vision for the development of the Champ des Possibles and introduce the biodiversity of this urban wasteland to the public. [I]Origins and developmentThe land: an abandoned wasteland in the heart of Mile EndThe Champ des Possibles corresponds to a space of nearly one hectare in Montreal, in the eastern sector of the Mile End, bounded by the railway line to the north, avenue Henri-Julien to the east, the large buildings of the avenue de Gaspé to the west and the former Viandes Saint-Laurent site to the south. Formerly called Champ Maguire, the land was a quarry operated during the 18th and 19th century, which then gradually gave way to a pond and a dumping ground. Drownings in the pond led to fill the unsanitary space. It was then acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1905 for its proximity to the railway line established in 1876. The Canadian Pacific Railway installed a marshalling yard there in 1906 [ii]. Abandoned at the beginning of the 1990s, the space gradually became an urban wasteland in the heart of an industrial district where green spaces and vacant lots were scarce [iii]. Gradually, the place becomes a space of citizen appropriation with multiple uses: spontaneous gatherings, campfires, picnics, but above all a space of circulation, shortened for the users heading towards the metro [iv].A buyout project by the City: the construction of a public problemOwned by the Canadian Pacific Railway, the wasteland was approached by the City of Montreal for a buyout at the end of the 2000s [v]. The City&#39;s project is to transform the green space into a “truck yard” [vi  ]  , which involves concreting this green space contaminated by decades of industrialization. Citizen mobilization is important to counter the development of the project, while the 2009 municipal electoral campaign is in full swing. The elections constitute a window of opportunity to make visible the project to protect the urban wasteland of the Champ des Possibles.2007-2009: citizen mobilization for the recognition of green spaceIn 2006, the City of Montreal joined forces with the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough to propose the holding of a consultation process on the future of the Maguire sector, which notably includes the abandoned wasteland [vii]. Many experts then mobilized to demonstrate the economic and real estate potential of this rapidly transforming space, in particular by the establishment of the Ubisoft company in the sector in 1997. As for citizens, they mobilized to promote the ecological value, social and cultural activity of the Champ Maguire wasteland. The mobilization has grown thanks to three types of action:at. An artistic mobilization in the service of a cultural space:An artist, Emily Rose Michaud, created in November 2007 a collaborative  land art  work to draw the public&#39;s attention to the Champ Maguire and its value, develop citizen engagement around the site and question the destruction project planned by the City. Entitled the &quot;Roerich Garden&quot;, this work refers to the Roerich Pact, a symbol of the Second World War used to convey to pilots in charge of dropping bombs information on sites of great cultural importance [viii]. Emily Rose Michaud has joined forces with the “Sprout Out Loud” garden collective to maintain, thanks to a local citizen mobilization, a Roerich symbol made of plants and rocks all year round for three years [ix]. The project was documented by an electronic book, gathering 40 texts and 1000 images, illustrating the citizen appropriation of the space and the attentiwe give by citizens to their territory through the project [x]. The artistic citizen mobilization testifies to the cultural value of a wasteland and the space of possibilities created by a wild park in the heart of the city, considered too precious to be the object of disappearance.b. Scientific mobilization in the service of biodiversityMore than 413 visible plant and animal species have been identified on the Champ Maguire site [xi]. An expert in urban biodiversity, Roger Latour, surveys the wasteland to identify the different species in order to feed his own research in natural history. The project to destroy the green space planned by the City of Montreal prompted it to mobilize a community of biologists and horticulturalists in defense of the site&#39;s ecological value. They then demonstrate, through scientific research, the importance of protecting the urban biodiversity that is created on post-industrial sites like Champ Maguire.vs. Citizen mobilization in the context of a participatory approach initiated by the CityThe publication of the first development guidelines for the sector by the City and the borough in 2006, then the announcement of an investment of $ 9 million for an urban development project in the sector in 2008 led the citizens of the district gathered within the Mile End Citizens Committee to mobilize. This committee, founded in 1982, brings together 600 citizens involved in improving the quality of their neighborhood and demonstrates a mobilizing force over time. The Mile End Citizens&#39; Committee invites the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough to dialogue with citizens about the future of the sector. This takes the form of a public meeting on April 9, 2008, which initiates a participatory citizen approach at the initiative of the Citizens&#39; Committee [xii]. The latter is organizing a series of citizen gatherings between May 2008 and April 2009. The citizen approach combines surveys of the local population and users, thematic citizen cafes (transport, housing, culture, economy and services, heritage and environment), visits and exploratory walks in the sector which culminate in the organization of a citizens&#39; forum on April 26, 2009. Through a theatrical presentation of the challenges of the sector followed by small group discussions, the forum allowed the emergence of guiding ideas and concrete proposals for the sector. It gathered 130 participants. The Champ has been the subject of several concrete proposals, including the creation of a public square open to residents, artists and artisans, but also the preservation of its wild side through decontamination by natural means to conserve the existing green space [xiii].2009-2013: institutionalization of the collective approachat. A mobilization in the context of municipal electionsAn informal collective brings together citizen mobilizations to demonstrate the cultural, ecological and social qualities of Champ Maguire. This collective takes the name of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles, thus renaming the Champ Maguire for the many opportunities it brings to the citizens of the district. It undertakes to give shape to the priorities established by the citizen forum and works on the drafting of a vision of the future for the urban wasteland. The citizen forum process then continues with ideation carts. These allow the realization of architectural plans presented to the City and to the various candidates for the municipal elections in 2009. The citizen&#39;s vision of the future brings together the different aspects of citizen mobilization around 7 priorities: the protection of the heritage character, of biodiversity , artistic practices, the promotion of educational practices, recreational planning, the development of the scientific and environmental dimension and support for the participatory process [xiv].b. Recognition of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles as interlocutor and co-managerProjet Montréal, the only party to fully adhere to the project presented by the collective, won the elections for the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough in 2009. In order to establish a dialogue with the elected officials of the borough, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles was institutionalized in the form of a non-profit organization in 2010. Collaboration was initiated with the borough to ensure the preservation and advancement of the project. After three years of negotiation and a consultationIn 2012, an amendment to the Town Planning Plan and the Borough&#39;s Town Planning Regulations made it possible to perpetuate the Champ des Possibles in 2013 with the granting of a natural area zoning [xv]. A co-management agreement in partnership between the borough and the Friends of the Champ des Possibles was also signed in 2013 for the years 2014 to 2017. It defines the Champ des Possibles as a &quot;space for innovative experiments in terms of sustainable development and practices linked to the preservation of the natural character of the environment ”and recognizes the Friends of the Field of the Possibles as“ privileged interlocutor of the citizen mobilization and the promotion of events and activities ”[xvi  ]  .2013 - 2020: Developmentsat. The co-management partnershipFrom 2014 to 2017, external programming activities are planned by the co-management agreement at the expense of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles. The renewal of the agreement in 2017 allows the granting of $ 20,000 per year for 3 years to carry out activities of animation, surveillance and control of ragweed [xvii  ]  . The functioning of the co-management is based on the creation of a committee bringing together members of the borough, a member of the board of directors and the coordinator of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles [xviii  ]  . Thanks to the service agreement, Les Amis du Champ des Possibles were able to benefit from a place at the negotiating table to assert their vision of the site&#39;s development, but also from renewed financial support over time, which enabled them to subsequently seek other grants and consolidate their structure. The organization was thus equipped with a coordination and project manager position (in 2014 and 2015), was able to set up a strategic plan and increase collaborations. However, co-management reveals issues regarding the sustainability of funding, since the agreement has not been renewed since 2019 for lack of agreement on financial support from the borough [xix  ]  .b. The mission of preserving biodiversityThe Friends of the Champ des Possibles mission is to &quot;perpetuate the Champ des Possibles as a public green space and urban biodiversity reserve&quot; but also to &quot;promote the creation of new green spaces and urban corridors&quot; [xx]. To do this, many partnerships have been established in the community of the Saint-Viateur East sector. Their objectives are to sensitize, mobilize and inform users of the Champ des Possibles on the process of rehabilitation and conservation of space. The organization is also joining forces with a group of university researchers to put forward the innovative aspects of the rehabilitation project, to list the biodiversity present and to think about new ways of decontaminating the field.In fact, the co-management agreement between the Amis du Champ des Possibles and the borough involves joint work to establish a contaminated soil rehabilitation plan in order to protect the 160 trees from some twenty species [xxi  ]  . The Champ des Possibles project thus differs greatly from naturalized development approaches, which involve decontamination before leaving nature the right to expand in the wild. The Friends of the Champ des Possibles aim to find alternative ways to decontaminate, without massive intervention in wasteland. This approach first of all contravenes municipal regulations which impose the decontamination of natural parks frequented by the public [xxii  ]  and thus makes the specificity of the Champ des Possibles project.To protect and promote the biodiversity present at the Champ des Possibles, census and cataloging activities are regularly undertaken and brought together under the name of “bioblitz” [xxiii  ]  , in collaboration with biology professionals. A biodiversity catalog was thus produced in 2014, listing the different species of flora and fauna in the park. It was updated and published again in 2017. Additional documents were also compiled: an inventory of insects, a state of health of the flora of the site, recommendations on maintenance for the years to come, etc.To ensure the protection of organicdiversity present on the site, cleaning chores are organized with the help of volunteers. They are aimed at cleaning the site, managing the garbage cans and extermination of the ragweed present in mass at the Champ des Possibles. These chores are possible thanks to numerous partnerships with facilitating organizations, whether they are specialized in volunteering or social and professional integration activities for young people (Katimavik, YMCA, Diners St-Louis, etc.). Finally, in 2017, funding by the borough enabled the formation of a volunteer green patrol involved throughout the summer, in particular for the removal of ragweed, in collaboration with the Atchoum organization, which provides expertise on the eradication of this allergenic plant [xxiv].vs. The educational and cultural missionThe mission of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles also includes an educational and cultural component, in order to &quot;promote and encourage popular education in natural sciences, history and the arts&quot; [xxv]. From 2015, a reception kiosk was installed in the park using a container in order to get as close as possible to the public and users. Many activities are organized on the site, thanks to partnerships or self-managed initiatives [xxvi  ]  . Thus, at the Champ des Possibles, it is possible to practice yoga, dance, botanical drawing, attend screenings by Wapikoni Mobile or even participate in day camps with The lion and the mouse. Numerous awareness-raising activities concerning the problem of ragweed are also undertaken on the site with signage but also among residents of the area through the distribution of flyers in letter boxes. To make scientific publications accessible, educational efforts are being made, such as the biodiversity catalog which has been adapted into a coloring book, sold for the benefit of the organization.Finally, numerous outreach activities, in the form of conferences, guided tours and kiosks are organized with the academic and professional world to publicize the mission of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles and ensure mobilization around the project.Organizational structure, membership and fundingOrganizational structureInitially organized in the form of an informal committee, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles collective was institutionalized to gain legitimacy vis-à-vis the public authorities. Became a non-profit organization in 2010, then co-manager of the Champ des Possibles in 2013 in collaboration with the Le Plateau-Mont-Royal borough, the organization has since set up offices in 2016 within the Temps Libre Mile cooperative. End which adjoins the park.MembershipThe organization works by involving its members in sub-committees for the development of projects or for the annual management of the park (art, biodiversity, maintenance, etc.). In 2018, 424 members are part of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles [xxvii].The operation of the structure is made according to the time and energies of each, because of the voluntary status of the members. However, paid positions seem to have been filled from time to time within the organization since 2014. A development coordination position has been occupied since January 2014, while temporary and contractual positions have emerged in 2015 as well as in 2017: responsible for the management of volunteers, responsible and support for ecological maintenance, biologists and entomologists.If the Friends of the Champ des Possibles rely on the support of their members, the organization also draws its legitimacy within the Saint-Viateur Est sector by the organization of citizen consultations on substantive reflections on the future. of the park and the area. In collaboration with the Mile End Citizens&#39; Committee, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles therefore act as an intermediary between the municipal authorities, with which they share the co-management of the site, and the citizens and users of the Champ des Possibles.Co-management committeeAs the beneficiary of a service agreement with the borough, the Amis du Champ des Possibles must report to municipal authorities, which implies the implementation of strategic plans and reviews each year. Management in collaboration with the borough is made possible through a cog committeeestion, bringing together representatives of the borough and administrators of Friends of the Field of Possibilities [xxviii] to discuss issues related to the management of the site. The files handled by the management committee overlap with the site rehabilitation plan, development, waste management, uses and nuisances, control of invasive species and the restoration strategy. The rehabilitation of contaminated soils mainly occupies the committee, since the borough, the City of Montreal and the Friends of the Champ des Possibles must agree to submit a plan for the rehabilitation of contaminated soils to the Ministry of sustainable development, the environment. and the fight against climate change.Funding, donations and servicesThe main funding of the Amis du Champ des Possibles was provided by the service agreement signed with the borough, granting $ 60,000 over three years, from 2017 to 2019. However, this funding is not assured since the agreement that was to be renewed in 2020 has still not been the subject of an agreement, the borough no longer wishing to contribute financially to the maintenance and animation of the Champ des Possibles. To ensure the financial stability of the organization, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles have sought grants from various funding sources. Fundraising is aimed just as much at university research granting organizations, thanks to the many partnerships forged with the scientific community, as at private foundations such as the TD Friends of the Environment Foundation and WWF Canada which fund projects at the Champ des Possibles in 2018. Funding requests for employment subsidies were also filed in 2018 in order to hire mainly volunteer labor on the project [xxix].Other sources of funding were provided by the community. Thus, a crowdfunding campaign in 2015-2016 enabled the contribution of $ 20,000 from 140 donors. This success led to a renewal of the formula in a monthly format in 2017. In addition, membership fees to become a member also provide a source of income for the Friends of the Champ des Possibles. Finally, the sale of derivative products since 2017 (herbaria, coloring book, sweaters, catalog) also provides funding for the mission. Part of the offer of workshops provided by the Friends of the Champ des Possibles could constitute an avenue of financing also by the sale of services [xxx  ]  .Specializations, methods and toolsCo-management of the site: a major player in the negotiationsThe Friends of the Champ des Possibles mission is to perpetuate the urban biodiversity reserve that is the Champ des Possibles [xxxi]. As such, decontamination and securing of the site polluted by decades of industrialization can only be done gradually, with minimal human intervention in space. However, this operation is contrary to municipal regulations. Thus, the laws require the remediation of contaminated sites before any construction of new facilities intended for wide use of the public. Decontamination by excavation is thus very often recommended [xxxii]. In addition, the security standards for urban development stipulate lighting, accessibility and visibility requirements. These two standards are contrary to the objectives of the Friends of the Field of Possibles project [xxxiii]. The co-management agreement therefore involves negotiations not only in the development, maintenance and animation of the site but also in the procedures and ways of doing municipal authorities. The fight led by the Friends of the Champ des Possibles could thus renew the protocols for the management of contaminated sites in Quebec by &quot;thinking them differently&quot; [xxxiv].In order to weigh in the negotiations and to be considered as a legitimate interlocutor of the public authorities, various strategies have been developed by the Friends of the Field of the Possibles.The first consists in the institutionalization of the mobilized collective into a structured non-profit organization. Thus, the demands are transformed into action plans, transposing the space of struggles into a language and a form understood by public powers.The second strategy deployed is to join forces with academia to promote the importance of biodiversity on the Champ des Possibles site. Citizen mobilization to defend the natural park project at Champ des Possibles was, among other things, initiated by a biologist who used the site as a reclaiming ground.search. Reconciliations with the scientific world continued thereafter, making it possible in particular to standardize the approaches and make the census procedures more rigorous by setting up a scientific protocol for data collection. But the work with scientists has also and above all made it possible to frame the mobilization in a scientific register, in order to gain legitimacy vis-à-vis the public authorities. The Friends of the Champ des Possibles thus seek to supervise and monitor the development of the project on the site in collaboration with universities. The avenues of research aim to develop a restoration plan based on a type of management different from that of urban parks, based on the idea that the site is alive and growing. “Ecological restoration focuses on creating the conditions necessary for the growth and evolution of a site as a living and changing system, intervening only as needed, and in order to offer greater diversity and resilience in the face of challenges [xxxv] ”. By translating the aspirations of the Friends of the Champ des Possibles into scientific language, the partnership with universities will be able to help offer clear orientations legitimized by university expertise with the City in order to modify park management practices.Finally, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles also rely on a citizen mobilization strategy by positioning themselves as an interlocutor between municipal authorities and the local population. In partnership with local organizations, such as the Mile End Citizens&#39; Committee, Espaces Temps or the Pépinière, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles are developing citizen consultation processes that legitimize the word they speak to the borough. This representational role is notably materialized during an Agora des Possibles project, set up between Espaces Temps, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles and Temps Libre Mile End and supported by the Le Plateau-Mont-Royal borough. The project aims to &quot;amplify citizen initiatives&quot; by stimulating the implementation of external interventions and offering a resource counter providing information on community projects within the district. The temporary developments proposed within the framework of Agora des Possibles were punctuated by mediation workshops and areas of free expression allowing dialogue between citizens and project leaders about the preliminary redevelopment plans of the areas invested. The Friends of the Champ des Possibles aimed by their participation in the mediation workshops to stimulate a critical mind in the face of the facilities offered to the public [xxxvi]. These consultation activities are regular for the organization, which in 2020 is starting a partnership with Concordia and McGill universities in order to understand the profile of users of the Champ des Possibles and understand the different uses of space [xxxvii]. Through this role of intermediary between the municipal authorities and the citizens of the district, the Friends of the Champ des Possibles benefit from a legitimacy from below vis-à-vis the public authorities.Major projects and eventsInitiatives carried out:- Chores: cleaning and maintenance of the space, plantations, control of invasive species, training of a volunteer maintenance team- Animation: census, guided tours, species identification workshops, botanical illustration, courses and scientific popularization on biodiversity, distribution of flowers, cinema, exhibition- Outreach activities: conferences, information kiosksSupported initiatives:- Citizen consultations and participatory co-design workshops- Animation in collaboration with sector organizationsPublicationsLes Amis du Champ des Possibles, “Activity Report 2014-2015”,  http://champdespossibles.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/rapport-dactivitc3a9_acdp_2014-20151.pdf  .Les Amis du Champ des Possibles, “2017 Activity Report”,  http://champdespossibles.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rapport-dactivitecc81s_acdp_20171.pdfFriends of the Field of Possibilities, &quot;Project Report 2017&quot;,  1  December 2017.  http://champdespossibles.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rapport-2017_convention-pmr-acdp.pdfFriends ofu Champ des Possibles, “2018 Activity Report”,  https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3Adaea44ed-8162-4e89-9a18-fae1eea42f7b#pageNum=1Les Amis du Champ des Possibles, 2019 Activity Report  https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A00ad5a44-8397-4168-878f-0ef5532e724c#pageNum=7See as wellhttps://champdespossibles.org/https://www.facebook.com/amisduchampdespossibles/http://roerichproject.artefati.ca/Notes[i] Les Amis du Champ des Possibles, 2019 Activity Report.  https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A00ad5a44-8397-4168-878f-0ef5532e724c#pageNum = 7[ii] Yves Desjardins, “The &#39;past past&#39; of the Champ des Possibles”, Mémoire du Mile End, 2019.  http://memoire.mile-end.qc.ca/fr/le-passe-anterieur-du-champ -of-possible /[iii] City of Montreal, Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, “Secteur Maguire.

It allowed the expropriation of the owner of the vacant lot at the intersection of 4  e  avenue and rue Masson in Montreal, as well as the purchase by the City of the green space now co-managed between the borough and the citizens of the district. According to the principles of participatory town planning and budgeting, the objectives of the project are as follows:Reveal the potential of spaceEngage citizens and the local community in the democratic appropriation of their living environmentBuild local knowledge on this site, and document the appropriation procedures and the site management model· Set up a process based on collective intelligence using a collaborative logic between citizens, local organizations, elected officials and professionals [i].Origins and developmentVacant land expropriated by the City in 2017The land, located in the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie borough in Montreal, has been left vacant for several decades. The space being used as a waste deposit, issues of sanitation and delinquency lead to the intervention of the borough, which wishes to buy back the fallow space to make a park [ii]. The land is evaluated at a cost of $ 141,300 by the City. In the absence of an agreement with the owner, the borough pleads for an expropriation by the City. The cost of the expropriation and the work required on the land is estimated at $ 400,000 [iii]. The City proceeded with the expropriation in 2017 and the land then returned to the borough.A co-design process in collaboration with community organizations and citizens (2017-2018)The borough wishes to develop the wasteland in collaboration with the citizens of the district: the project constitutes the first citizen participation initiative piloted between the borough and the citizens. To do this, the borough is inspired by participatory budget experiences and mandates the community organization Lande as well as the Urban Ecology Center to jointly carry the initiative. The project takes the name of Hollow Dents and is based on an “iterative formula for transforming vacant land through temporary interventions” [iv]. The ideation and co-design of the site take place from June to September 2018 and residents of the neighborhood are invited to come up with ideas for transforming the space into a park, reflecting the neighborhood and its needs. About ten citizens took part in the entire process, from the ideation workshops to the final development, carried out following a vote by residents of the neighborhood. Three projects were submitted to the district&#39;s vote: an art and biodiversity trail, a ludic and green relaxation area and a meeting and gathering space. It is the proposal for the development of a ludic and green relaxation area that has attracted the greatest number of people in this family neighborhood. The development involves in this regard the construction of a vertical green wall, the presence of Adirondack chairs and hammock support and finally a space for free play. Voting could be done online on the Réalisons Montréal [v] page, in businesses adjacent to the future park or even in the project area during organized voting days. It is important to note that the vote was open to residents of the area aged 12 and over [vi].L&#39;Îlot des murmures, the first project and model of citizen participation in co-managementOriginally called Îlot de la 4  e  , the green space transformed by citizens was inaugurated on September 15, 2018. It is now called the Îlot des murmures. There is a grassy area, a green wall, tubs of edible plantations and furniture to take a break and socialize [vii  ]  . The place is also intended to be a space animated by the residents of the district: surveys on the collective&#39;s Facebook page are launched to develop activities and events in response to the needs and desires of the inhabitants of the area. Among the activities offered are yoga classes, picnics, storytelling readings as well as workshops (fermentation, microgreens, etc.).This project is the first participatory initiativeWe are a citizen piloted between the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie borough and the citizens. The project will also benefit in 2019 from the support of the borough&#39;s “Citizen participatory projects” program. This program aims to facilitate the implementation of projects by citizens in their living environments. The borough&#39;s support then made it possible to improve the existing facilities and to make the park more green. The experience of the Îlot des murmures is also a model for citizen initiatives, as demonstrated in particular by its regular mention by groups of citizens mobilized in other spaces [viii  ]  , by its highlighting on the promotional video. of the Citizen Participatory Projects program [ix  ]  and by the awarding of a group volunteering prize in 2019 by the Montreal Urban Ecology Center as part of the Volunteer Recognition Gala in Montreal.Organizational structure, membership and fundingOrganizational structureThe organizational structure is relatively flexible for this initiative. Its particularity is to be supervised and driven by the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie borough and managed by two community organizations, Lande and the Montreal Urban Ecology Center. As such, the Îlot des murmures is the first citizen participation project co-managed by the borough and by citizens.The Lande organizations and the Montreal Urban Ecology Center (CÉUM) play a facilitating role to allow citizens to develop their own projects [x]. Lande&#39;s mission is to facilitate the citizen reappropriation of vacant land in Montreal, by promoting innovative approaches to participatory democracy [xi] while the CÉUM helps to equip citizens and organizations to create a city on a human scale, generating solutions to act on current challenges [xii]. The project jointly developed between Lande and the CÉUM, Les dents creuses, aims to transform “vacant municipal land through an approach inspired by the participatory budget to generate and carry out citizen projects for the development of public space” [xiii ]. L&#39;Îlot des murmures is the first co-creation initiative resulting from the Dents creuses project and supported by a Montreal borough. It was one of the first projects supported by the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie Citizen Participatory Projects program, in order to reproduce this type of initiative in other sectors of the borough.The support of the organizations Lande and CÉUM allows a flexible structure for the citizens invested in the Îlot des murmures. They can benefit from the benefits accorded to registered community nonprofits - such as receiving grants - through sponsorship from Lande and CÉUM, without having to set up their own organizational structure and meet the rigid frameworks required for them. NPO. A certain flexibility in the organizational structure was therefore demonstrated within the framework of the project. To cite an example, let us note the granting of a right to vote within the project to any citizen of the neighborhood aged 12 years and over [xiv].MembershipL&#39;Îlot des murmures is based on a flexible and relatively informal collective: the conditions for being part of it are not very restrictive. All you have to do is fill out a declaration of interest form available on  Google Forms  , or mention your participation to a manager in charge of an activity or even come to the scene for an event. The collective works around a hard core of ten people involved throughout the process of ideation and planning of the space. It also joins and mobilizes the community of neighborhood residents, called upon from time to time for chore-type activities or to vote for project ideas they want to see happen. To guarantee the involvement of neighborhood residents as a priority, mobilization is carried out according to residence criteria and through different communication vectors: local facebook groups, facebook page of the Îlot aux murmures, leaflets in shops, word of mouth as well as through the “bike with ideas” [xv], a mobile citizen participation kiosk initiated by the CÉUM to pedal directly to meet citizens.Committees and sub-committees are set up to carry out the various projects and tasks of the collective, overseen by the citizens&#39; committee bringing together the volunteersinvolved in the maintenance of the space and by the management committee. They meet monthly to ensure the maintenance and animation of the space. Their operation is based on democratic and non-hierarchical principles of self-management.Funding, donations and servicesL&#39;îlot des murmures benefits from several supports which have enabled the development of the project. Les Dents creuses was launched thanks to the support of Je fais Mtl and the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie borough, which notably enabled the municipal redemption of the land from the owner. The project benefited from grants, notably from the City of Montreal, which supported the development of the project up to $ 20,000 in 2018, with the support of the local Desjardins caisse which also provided $ 2,000. These investments made it possible to animate the codesign process with citizens and to promote the final development by residents of the area. The City also provided furniture, including swings and Adirondack chairs to furnish the park. As part of the Citizen Participatory Projects program, the borough granted an additional $ 10,000 in support to the initiative in 2019, in order to improve the site&#39;s development.The Îlot des murmures also benefits from a system of donations and services by the local community, mobilized around the project. The facebook group l&#39;Îlot des murmures de la 4e thus identifies many offers of assistance and services from the citizens of the district, in the form of donations of seeds, materials, etc.Specializations, methods and toolsParticipatory method: co-creation and co-management of the siteThe Les Dents creuses project specializes in citizen co-creation approaches with the expertise of Lande community organizations and the Montreal Urban Ecology Center. The objective of the project is to support and equip communities to appropriate their living environment and co-create public space from vacant municipal spaces. The co-creation process proposed by Les Dents creuses is short and intense and is based on the principles of the participatory budget to engage the community and citizens in the democratic appropriation of public space. All the development phases of the greening project involve citizens, elected officials and local organizations in a collaborative logic.L&#39;îlot des murmures is the pilot project of the Les Dents creuses project. Here are the stages of the process and the various achievements made between May and September 2018:- Call and ideation: what are the needs?o Two needs identification kiosks.o Ideation workshops bring together citizens mobilized during face-to-face meetings, in order to collectively define the basic values of the project and the common rules. An idea bike travels the neighborhood to meet citizens and collect their suggestions.- Development of citizen proposals - craftsman workshopo 3 collective project development workshops- Face-to-face and online exhibition - votingo 2 polling kiosks, 2 polling stations and one online vote (219 citizens votes)- Design of the prioritized projecto 1 priority project design workshop- Realization of projectso 7 weeks of project implementation and an inaugural activityMore than 800 hours of volunteer work were carried out to bring about the Îlot des murmures park. The project brought together the local community, as demonstrated by the 219 citizens&#39; votes to elect the development proposal to be prioritized [xvi], but also the presence of nearly 200 members on the Îlot des murmures Facebook group, and 180 members on the Facebook page. Based on the Citizen Participatory Projects approach, the borough&#39;s program supporting the project in 2019, the citizen collective relies on the mobilization of a given sector, defined as a place of life under the name of Masson Village. The initiative therefore aims to federate a community at the local level, which is also demonstrated by the limitation of votes to residents of the sector neighboring the future developed space.A fois the landscaped park, it is now up to citizens to assume co-management with the borough of Montreal. Monthly meetings then bring together the committees to ensure the good democratic management of the space. The methods used throughout the project development process and for which the mobilized citizens were equipped by Hollow Dents have since been incorporated into the management of the site. We can thus mention the regular holding of brainstorms and online surveys to make democratic decisions on site development or animation.Scope of the projectThe Hollow Dents project arose out of discussions held during workshops organized by Faire Montréal which aimed to support the realization of creative projects offering innovative tools to citizens to act and transform the city [xvii]. In this regard, Les Dents creuses offers &quot;a democratic and participatory solution to the urban problem of vacant land&quot;, a key issue in Montreal [xviii]. It thus makes it possible to offer a management model for a participatory experience involving citizens in all stages of the development and management of the project. The objective of the Dents creuses is to apply this co-creation process in all Montreal boroughs.Major projects and events- Initiatives carried out:o Chores: cleaning and maintenance of the space, plantations, construction of furnitureo Festive events: Picnics, sugar shack, children&#39;s play activitieso Workshops and courses: micro shoot, yoga, fermentation- Supported initiatives: citizen and activist mobilizationo Support for the local community: competitions organized with local businesseso Militant activities related to the environment and climate change: procession during demonstrations for the climate, signing of petitions, declaration of climate emergencyPublicationsCÉUM, “Hollow teeth, a vacant space transformed by a co-creation approach inspired by the participatory budget”, 2018.  https://cdn.ca.yapla.com/company/CPYO9qxj5LhP6vbo8lrLkiEO/asset/files/FPRO_LDC-Rosemont_20181125.pdfLande &amp; Solon, “Eco-citizen action laboratory”.

It aims at the collective reappropriation of the old railway right-of-way at the corner of rue St -Urbain and Beaubien in the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough in Montreal. The Friends of the Gorilla Park want to restore the natural and wild character of the old wasteland, in order to develop a public park there with, by and for the community of the Marconi-Alexandra sector. To do this, the approach is based on the principles of social ecology, wishing to put &quot;the social and ecological dimensions at the forefront of responsible urban development in line with the needs and aspirations&quot; of the district  [i]  .The objectives of the organization are as follows:o Restore the natural and wild character of the old Canadian Pacific railway right-of-wayo Develop and maintain a green and public space, intended to improve the urban environment, promote urban biodiversity and enhance the natural and human heritage of the neighborhood  [ii]Origin and developmentsThe land: an abandoned railway right-of-wayThe land located in the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough, in the Marconi-Alexandra district, between Saint-Zotique streets to the north, Beaubien to the south, Saint-Urbain and Waverly was a railway right of way of the Canadian railway company. Pacific since the end of the 19th century. The land of more than 5,000 square meters was abandoned by the company in the 1990s and was replaced by wasteland in the wild. The site has been re-appropriated as a green space by the residents of the district, in an area with little greenery and particularly affected by heat islands [iii]. The name of the Gorilla Park was attributed to the site, in reference to the aspect of urban jungle that it represents in the middle of the city [iv].A sector deforested by the owner: the construction of the public problemIn 2013, Canadian Pacific sold the land to developer Olymbec who, without authorization or permit, felled some fifty trees and carried out earthworks. The answer is twofold: the borough of Rosemont-Petite-Patrie and the City of Montreal give the owner a statement of offense, while residents mobilize in the face of deforestation to organize the conversion of the site into a public space. It is in this context and to defend this cause that the informal committee of Friends of the Gorilla Park was created in 2013. The collective arose out of the popular demonstration in reaction to the deforestation of the land, now covered with gravel.2013-2017: mobilization to protect urban green spaceThe mobilization of citizens leads to the imposition of a land reserve for the end of the park by the borough from 2013. The objective is then to prevent the developer from implementing a construction project on the site. The group of AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles is then defined by a work of “political lobbying” with the bodies in charge of the file [v]. To do this, the demands of the citizen collective are in line with the priorities established for the sector by the Urban, Economic and Social Development Plan (PDUES) of the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough [vi] which already provides for a park in the area. west of Saint-Laurent Boulevard. In addition, the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles committee, although informal, works in close collaboration with two formal bodies mandated by the borough, namely the Regroupement des tables de concertation de la Petite-Patrie and the Société de développement environnement de la Petite-Patrie. Rosemont (SODER). Thus, the demands of the committee to make this issue known can find an echo with interlocutors close to the public authorities.From 2014, the borough formally undertakes to create a park in co-management with the residents of the district on the site of the Parc des Gorilles. Relations with the borough were facilitated by the direct link with SODER and by a favorable reception from the mayor of the borough, whom he met on several occasions. Regarding relations with the city center, the collective was able to meet the officials in charge of the file three times between 2013 and 2017 [vii]. A pressure campaign was put inworks to change the negotiations before the expiration of the land reserve for the end of the park.The committee&#39;s vision for the park is regularly put forward, whether by the drafting of a manifesto by the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles in 2014 [viii] or by consulting the district on the creation of development prototypes. for the site in 2015. Two development proposals emerge, synthesized with the collaboration of the Eco-neighborhood Rosemont-Petite-Patrie. They mainly aim to make the Gorilla Park an ultra local area of wild biodiversity [ix]. These co-creation, formalization and documentation efforts implemented by the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles bear witness to the proposed co-management approach between the City and the committee. In 2015, a prize awarded by the grouping of Eco-Quartiers for the organization&#39;s 20th anniversary attests to the recognition and legitimacy granted to the Committee of Friends of the Gorilla Park.While the City is trying to negotiate with the Olymbec company that owns the land, residents are reclaiming the park through actions to occupy and animate the space. Thus, cleaning chores, gardening activities in tubs, social activities such as picnics or barbecue, and heritage transmission activities such as guided tours (Jane&#39;s walks in particular [x]) or walks are organized. in kind [xi]. Relations with the owner remain stormy since he refuses citizen appropriation, although transitory, of the space. In 2015, Olymbec thus issued a formal notice to two members of the Committee of Friends of the Gorilla Park to remove the urban agriculture bins and the temporary furniture installed [xii]. The committee is turning to ad hoc occupancy actions during events such as Parking Day, which aims to reflect on the issues relating to the use of parking spaces in Montreal. The occupations of the space then aim to challenge passers-by and mobilize residents on the issue of the site, inform about its history and promote the actions of the collective.2017-2021: institutionalization and participatory approach in the management of the future Gorilla ParkOn March 13, 2017, the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough council voted to expropriate Olymbec, for park purposes, for lack of common ground obtained through negotiation attempts by the City. If the transaction is effected at a cost of $ 250,000 [xiii], the City has made a provision of $ 5.4 million to cover the costs of acquiring and developing the site [xiv].In reaction to this first victory, the Committee of Friends of the Gorilla Park was formed in September 2017 as a non-profit organization (NPO) and held its first general assembly. The organization&#39;s mandate is to prepare the ground for the redevelopment of a park in co-management with the borough of Rosemont-Petite-Patrie. The institutionalization of the committee as an NPO then aims to ensure negotiation with the public authorities in the development of the park. Once constituted as an NPO, the AmiEs du parc des Gorilles demand a meeting with the political leaders involved in the file as well as a contractual document stipulating a co-management agreement to ensure the &quot;delegation to the organization of the responsibilities of maintenance and animation of the site and the installations of the future park ”[xv].In this regard, the co-management agreement as discussed provides for the collaboration of the public authorities with the organization of the AmiEs du Parc des Gorille on several levels: the development of the redevelopment of the park with the citizens of the sector to meet the needs. of the citizens on the site, as well as a legacy of the maintenance of the space to the residents. This model of governance through public participation responds to an opening up of the production of public action to new actors alongside the public authorities. There is then a decentralization of the provision of services to external actors, such as private companies or non-profit organizations [xvi], such as the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles. Collaboration between citizens engaged and organized in NPOs allows the sharing of collective decision-making but carries a risk of disengagement of the State and delegation of the management of public spaces to weakened entities because not funded and voluntary.The efforts to formalize a site redevelopment proposal led the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles to receive the special mention of the jury during the competition.rs of the Urban Design Association of Quebec (ADUQ) in 2017 for the installation “Redesigning the Saint-Urbain / Beaubien intersection” during Park (ing) Day Montreal. The installation was carried out in collaboration with other informal community and collective organizations in Montreal.In 2019, the “political lobbying” work of the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles led to the implementation of a citizen participation process linked to the development of the future park, in collaboration with the City and the borough. It materializes the NPO&#39;s efforts towards a co-management agreement, although it has still not been signed. But the consultation process is also part of a major urban project to redevelop an industrial wasteland in the Outremont sector and its surroundings, under the name of the MIL Montreal project [xvii]. This development project is led by the City of Montreal in partnership with the University of Montreal and represents nearly $ 175 million.Regarding the Gorilla Park sector, the citizen participation approach takes shape in space co-design workshops as well as online surveys with residents of the sector. The consultation process will continue throughout 2020, to make way for work on the site in 2021.In addition to the consultation process carried out with the City, the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles organization organizes festive and cultural activities on the site of the Parc des Gorilles to inform and mobilize the neighborhood as well as local stakeholders. We can mention in this regard the realization of a mural representing an urban jungle in August 2018, the organization of a street party entitled &quot;Bloc Party&quot; in a musical and festive atmosphere in August 2019 as well as the holding of a retrospective exhibition. artistic and activist interventions by AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles in October 2019.Organizational structure, membership and fundingInitially organized in the form of an informal committee, the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles collective has gradually become institutionalized to gain legitimacy vis-à-vis the public authorities. It was incorporated into a non-profit organization in 2017 and set up offices, located near the Gorilla Park, on Waverly Street.MembershipMembership within the NPO is based on a principle of proximity to the park. The organization thus defines three types of members, namely the status of regular members for people domiciled in the sector; the status of associate members for people whose workplace is located in the sector and finally the status of sympathetic members for people who do not correspond to the first criteria [xviii]. If any member has the right to speak, the draft resolutions must be proposed and seconded by a regular member to be put to a vote, which aims to ensure the representativeness of residents within the organization.If the organization operates with a membership system, it was established in 2019 since a first membership campaign was organized in October 2019. Since the committee began, it should be noted that the various activities organized have spontaneously mobilized up to two hundred citizens of the neighborhood and elsewhere.Board of directorsMade up of five to seven people, the board of directors brings together profiles with skills that are beneficial to the organization. Thus, between 2017 and 2020 there followed one another in particular an urban planner - designer, a journalist, two landscape architects and planning consultants and visual artists. It should also be noted the presence of a representative of SODER, then of Réseau Quartiers Vertes of the Montreal Urban Ecology Center, confirming the partnership with these two organizations [xix]. Relatively stable, the board of directors relies on a core of five people involved from the start in the preservation of space [xx].FundingThe AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles organization, once incorporated as an NPO, now requires funds. A campaign to join the NPO is organized in October 2019. The search for funding also leads to the allocation of a $ 3,000 scholarship by participants in the participatory budget &quot;Round trip&quot; organized by the provincial deputy of sector, Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois for the allocation of his discretionary budget. The sum offered to the Friends of the Gorilla Park will allow &quot;the organization of cultural and social activitiess aiming to bring together and mobilize the community around the park project ”[xxi].Specializations, methods and toolsPolitical lobbying: advocacy with elected officialsMeans deployedLes AmiEs du parc des Gorilles specializes in political lobbying activities with institutions. Indeed, formalization as a non-profit organization aims to play a mediating role between the citizens of the sector and the borough. To requests to meet with elected officials to advance the acquisition and management of the park, Les AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles put pressure on elected officials by several means, such as meeting requests, speeches during city council meetings of the City of Montreal but also massive sending of emails or letters to politicians.These advocacy activities require the support of citizens around the project, to gain legitimacy with elected officials and support lobbying activities. Thus, to inform and mobilize passers-by and residents of the area, the Friends of the Gorilla Park also organize various actions around the park: speaking out on the site, spontaneous groups organized to denounce the work by the owner, mobilizations on social networks and various festive and artistic activities such as a musical parade in the streets of the district to distribute pamphlets on the situation of the park for example [xxii].Framing of mobilizationsLes AmiEs du parc des Gorilles asked their partners to make their voices heard by elected officials and municipal councilors. Collaborations are in this sense crucial and also come to determine the form that the collective struggles take. Thus, the Rosemont Environmental Development Society (SODER) played a leading role with the collective, one of its members being involved from the start of the mobilization within the Friends of the Gorilla Park. By acting as an intermediary with the representatives of the borough, SODER has enabled the collective&#39;s demands to find an institutional voice that has made the fight for the restoration of green space gain credibility. In addition, the support provided by SODER has greatly contributed to the institutionalization of the collective through the evolution of the mission and its constitution as an NPO [xxiii].An institutionalization strategy chosen among othersThe institutionalization of the collective responds to a change in strategy since the first activities of the collective consisted of occupying the space of the old park in an informal way, in particular by transitional arrangements on the site. While the owner Olymbec sends a formal notice to two members of the collective, Les AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles decide to change tactics. Rather than mobilizing the community on the site to counter the owner&#39;s actions, the collective is moving towards advocacy with the municipal authorities in charge of the file.Bringing its demands to the institutional scene then leads to a formalization of collective practices. To ensure their long-term mobilization, the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles are adopting a new tactic of political advocacy and framing their demands in a formal approach consistent with the plans and priorities of the borough for the sector. To do this, the collective relies on institutional documents such as the Urban, Economic and Social Development Plan (PDUES) of the Rosemont-Petite-Patrie borough [xxiv] which provides for a park on the site of the old abandoned wasteland.Thanks to the institutionalization of the struggles, the AmiEs du Parc des Gorilles organization is calling for joint management of the green space in collaboration with the borough.

The project aims to co-construct with citizens a vision of the future for each of the living environments identified and to develop collective solutions to make it a reality. The Oasis Bellechasse is one of the collective solutions identified and implemented in the Bellechasse sector, selected for the project.The objectives of the “Our living environments” project are the mobilization and support of citizens in the development of capacities, and the fight against climate change in living environments. The objectives of Oasis Bellechasse are as follows:- Animation of public spaces and strengthening of the social fabric- Calming traffic and securing the neighborhood- Citizen reappropriation, neighborhood vitality and improvement of the quality of life- Greening of the city [i]Origins and developmentThe living environment: A little-frequented public square and an area of strong citizen mobilizationThe “Our living environments” project was initiated in October 2016 by Solon, Coop Carbone, the UQAM Research Chair on ecological transition and the Center for the Study of Social Responsibility and Ecocitizenship. Solon is in charge of the mobilization capacity and the co-creation process of the project, Coop Carbone is in charge of technical expertise, the UQAM Research Chair on ecological transition participates in project documentation and knowledge transfer, in conjunction with the Center for Social Responsibility and Eco-citizenship [ii]. These organizations constitute a steering committee, in charge of identifying living environments within which to mobilize citizens [iii]. The choice of the district in which to deploy the citizens&#39; initiative is therefore up to the organizations facilitating the project.The “living environment” refers to the different targets targeted by the project: a certain degree of citizen mobilization, a diversity of socioeconomic profiles, a diversity of commercial vitality, diversity in access to collective mobility and the presence of others. facilitating conditions [iv]. Two areas of intervention are selected following this evaluation by the steering committee, including the Bellechasse sector. The latter was chosen for the presence of a strong citizen mobilization on the territory, which is expressed in particular by the many projects of green alleys in the district [v]. These also testify to a degree of cooperation between citizens and the district, open to participatory approaches in the management of public space.The location chosen for the Bellechasse sector project corresponds to a public square with little traffic. Place Hector-Prud&#39;homme is located at the entrance to Plaza Saint-Hubert, in an area with high commercial density. Inaugurated in 2009 by the City of Montreal, this mineral square was designed as a multipurpose space &quot;which also allows for the holding of various community and entertainment activities&quot; [vi].A process of co-creating a vision for the futureTo follow up on the selection phase of living environments, the Solon organization, in cooperation with local partners, and more specifically by the green lane committees of the sector, mobilized the citizens of the Bellechasse sector to hold 8 workshops. discussion between April and August 2017. The objective of the meetings was to produce a diagnosis of the living environment, formulate motivations for carrying out the project and define projects to be carried out. Field visits completed the participatory system aimed at co-constructing visions of the future for the Bellechasse sector.If the district is considered friendly and pleasant by the participants, it is also a victim of security and traffic issues. The motivations for the project are therefore aimed at slowing down traffic, improving safety and greening the living environment. Among the projects proposed in response to the targeted issues: alley chores, developments protecting pedestrians and cyclists and guaranteeing them safe mobility, night lighting in the alleys. The vision offuture developed at the end of the workshops focuses on &quot;the animation of public spaces, calming traffic and anchoring in an urban fabric marked by a major shopping street&quot; [vii]. The project mainly brings together citizens who are already active, involved in other collective projects [viii].A lively public squareAt the end of the discussions, the citizens of the neighborhood are supported in the development of collective solutions for the neighborhood. Among the projects proposed for the Bellechasse sector, it is the development of a public square as a lively meeting place within the district that is selected. The Oasis Bellechasse thus takes place in February 2018 in the Hector-Prud&#39;homme public square.The reflections initiated during the project are extended by seven participating citizens who constitute the collective of the Oasis Bellechasse project. “Collective Wednesdays”, carried by the citizens of the collective, bring together once a month the citizens of the district to discuss the issues of the living environment, the animation and the management of the public square. Thus, the co-management approach is continued beyond the “Our living environments” project.The Oasis Bellechasse is a green space made up of various temporary rest and relaxation facilities, such as picnic tables, a book box, a platform, armchairs, in order to transform the Hector-Prud mineral square. man in a public place where to rest, meet and exchange. The activities held during the summer season are numerous and varied: meditation, concerts, storytelling, dance workshops, creative workshops, children&#39;s games, drawing, cinema, etc. [ix] thanks to numerous partnerships.Organizational structure, membership and fundingOrganizational structureThe organizational structure of Oasis Bellechasse resumes in a certain way the co-creation process initiated by the “Our living environments” project. Thus, the collective in charge of the management of the public square is made up of ten members, including seven residents of the district, accompanied by a member of the Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie borough and two members of the facilitating organizations Solon and the Center for the study of social responsibility and eco-citizenship [x].The structure is based on the holding of monthly “collective Wednesdays”, which bring together citizens interested in the project to reflect on the neighborhood in transition and the solutions to be provided. Citizens are invited to participate in many ways: through online surveys soliciting programming ideas, by holding monthly meetings and by participating in co-creative workshops to build, maintain and green the spatial arrangements. . The collective&#39;s Facebook page allows citizens to communicate and engage with the project. It is followed by more than 500 subscribers [xi].Funding, donations and servicesThe co-creation process resulting from the “Our living environments” project was made possible thanks to a grant from the Action-Climat Québec program, from the Québec Action Fund for Sustainable Development [xii]. To ensure the completion of the project selected for Place Hector Prud&#39;homme, funding of $ 10,000 from the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie borough was obtained in 2018. It was used to animate the site for the summer period. and the purchase of building materials [xiii]. This funding was supplemented by the allocation in 2018 of a scholarship of $ 3,000 by participants in the participatory budget &quot;Round trip&quot; organized by the provincial deputy of the sector, Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, for the distribution of his discretionary budget. . This funding is renewed in 2019 [xiv] for the development and animation of the space.Finally, the Oasis Bellechasse is part of a commercial sector, at the entrance to Plaza Saint-Hubert and also benefits from donations and services from local merchants. The neighboring business The mirrored cabinet thus lends picnic tables to the Oasis Bellechasse, since the development of rest areas within the sector encourages its customers in return [xv].Specializations, methods and toolsAn experimentation process initiated by a network of institutional actorsThe “Our living environments” project is based on a theoretical approach to transition and an experimentation process. Through experimentation, the project stakeholders put forward a concrete learning process for change and ecological transitionin a context of uncertainty which characterizes global problems. This learning-by-doing takes up the theoretical base of the transitions approach, that is to say “implementing reflexive governance systems which consist in generating and integrating networks of actors and of innovation which reinforce each other through their actions, experiments, projects and practices ”[xvi]. Thus, in the case of the “Our living environments” project, the steering committee is made up of the association of two community organizations, Solon and Coop Carbone, and a research organization, the UQAM Research Chair on ecological transition. In addition, the project governance committee integrates a network of community and innovation organizations, such as the Social Economy Worksite, Innovative Territories in Social and Solidarity Economy (TIESS), the Center d &#39; study in social responsibility and eco-citizenship (CERSÉ), the Rosemont Environmental Development Company (SODER), L&#39;Esplanade, Fondaction and CIRODD. These multiple actors help to diversify the expertise in order to be able to measure and report on the impacts of the project since &quot;Our living environments&quot; emerges from a questioning of community actors on the potential of existing green lane projects to contribute to the transition. ecological. It is therefore important to mobilize many actors to measure and evaluate the effects of the projects deployed. The Oasis Bellechasse is therefore not the result of a citizens&#39; initiative as such. Rather, the project stems from a questioning of actors from community and innovation circles who will in return mobilize and support the emergence of local citizen initiatives.The project therefore aims to &quot;put in place a structured and reflective process through which local partners, citizens and a group of researchers identify the needs and issues of sustainability and undertake to develop pilot projects making it possible to act and learn about the transition ”[xvii]. To do this, an iterative approach is implemented, following these different steps:Creation of a steering committee, assessment and identification of living environmentsMobilization of living environments and development of desirable visions of the futureIdentification of a diagnosisFormulation of motivationsDefinition of projects to be undertakenDefinition of a vision for the futureSelection of projects and implementationTransferThe project, if it enabled the realization of the Oasis Bellechasse, nevertheless shows a certain gap between the expectations of the citizens involved and of the steering committee from the community. The temporalities are different. On the one hand, citizens&#39; time is voluntary and therefore counted. He is punctual, punctuated by evenings and weekends. We must therefore maximize it and prevent the involvement of citizens from appearing in vain over time. On the other hand, the duration of the project is marked by identified phases, by the intensity of citizen involvement and by impacts linked to the requirements of donors [xviii]. The project therefore develops at a distance from concrete citizens&#39; initiatives emerging directly from citizens.Scope of the projectThe “Our living environments” project ends with a transfer phase. The Oasis Bellechasse therefore resembles a pilot project, destined to be reproduced in other areas of the borough. The success of Oasis Bellechasse has thus enabled the creation of a funding program for the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie borough. In February 2019, the latter implemented “Citizen participatory projects” which offers residents the opportunity to take charge of the greening and animation of vacant spaces or public places thanks to the granting of a grant of $ 10,000 per project and through support from the Montreal Urban Ecology Center and Solon [xix]. The project is therefore intended to be replicated in 25 sectors of the borough. Building on the learning at the end of the ideation phase of the Oasis Bellechasse, the “Citizen participatory projects” require an emerging mobilization of citizens themselves and not of community actors.Major projects and eventsInitiatives carried outIdeation and arrangement: collective Wednesdays, co-creation workshop, arrangement, plantations, construction of furniture, maintenanceFestive events and cultural activities: concerts, exhibitions, inauguration, back-to-school party, cinema, storytelling, collaborative games,  family activities, meditation,Workshops and courses: introduction to permaculture, drawing, making solar lights, making notebooks, dancing, sculpture, introduction to town planningSupported initiatives100 in 1 day: international day of citizen collaborationPublicationsCities, “The urban commons.

Through this activity, a group of young people receive training in social rights and then go to secondary schools to work with schoolchildren on values such as tolerance, non-discrimination and equality. Provide formal and non-formal education centers with tools for the promotion and education of social rights, gender equity and environmental sustainability.  It proposes a methodology in minors and adolescents, between 6 and 18 years old. The objectives are framed in groups of children from 6 to 18 years in the educational system, as future agents of social change.  Educational professionals and monitors, as reference figures in the socialization process and important agents when it comes to transmitting concepts and training.Origins and Development  Da2 Trucados Association was born as a response to a willing concern to share and disseminate as a form of alternative leisure, with the joint effort of a group of fans, board games. With the intention of promoting this modality of leisure among the citizens of the Costa Tropical, created this community with the desire to attract another large number of fans, and to instill the values that are present in this type of activities. Initially among our objectives is to promote the Board Games as a means to develop positive attitudes such as teamwork, imagination, creativity, in addition to promoting them as a leisure alternative, promoting a youthful and adult leisure activity, healthy and responsible.Although the association was created at the beginning of 2014, most of the people who are part of ""Da2 Trucados"" have a good curriculum of game moments and we have had the experience of being able to enjoy them with many friends throughout life, and to share these recreational activities with other groups of people.Main Projects and Events  During these years since the association was constituted, we have carried out lucid activities and acts in the town in collaboration with the area of youth and culture of the City of Almuñécar. During these years we participated in the ""Fair of Associations"" organized by the Social Welfare Area of the City of Almuñécar, obtaining as a result a great participation, in addition to being a great showcase to make ourselves known, we left there very happy to receive a special recognition for our involvement in bringing board games, and the attitudes they bring,to youth.It has also collaborated in the campaign ""Almuñécar Ciudad Sana"", an event organized by the Youth and Social Welfare Council of the city of Almuñécar, to bring other leisure models to youth away from the consumption of alcohol and other drugs. The Association, during the Fridays of the months of July and August, has mounted workshops and organized various activities to show and teach the young people of the town another way to have fun and enjoy their leisure time in a cooperative and healthy way.  In addition to these local activities, it has collaborated in others of a regional nature, as well as the collaboration of other national associations. Da2 Trucados participates in the European projects  Eramus + Demogames  and  PeaceGamesHubConnect with young people by getting them to appropriate personal and social values through socio-playful activities.

[1]  Origins and Development  Founder Rand Strauss stumbled on this in 2011, beginning with the belief that accountability is necessary, missing, and was never designed into democracies.[2]According to Strauss,""[b]ecause it was absent, political parties formed and then money was needed to win elections. The American political system was designed to handle neither of these. They've burdened other democracies as well - choosing a party allows a person to choose a coarse position on all issues instead of expressing choice on each issue.""  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Currently PeopleCount is the sole founder's part-time project. It's also a California B-corp (for the benefit of society), but there are no employees or assets, so it's easily changed. There's no funding.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  It's been said that anything is possible when adults communicate. However, political communication often appears to be primitive, ineffective and much of it is childish (divisive). Political communication must occur between everyone, so everyone can govern  together . Yet human communication systems are 1 &lt;--&gt; 1, 1-&gt;many, few &lt;--&gt; few, or few-&gt;many. Voting is the only many&lt;--&gt;many communication system, and it's seldom used. PeopleCount specializes in a system designed for efficient 1&lt;--&gt;many and many&lt;--&gt;many communication.  Major Projects and Events  Oct 2020: The founder is building a web app, slowly. To be kept informed, people can  join a mailing list .  Analysis and Lessons Learned1. Discovered about ""accountability"" :Accountability is required for democracy to reliably work [3]  Few people have a clear, rigorous definition of accountability [4]  Very little accountability occurs during elections. [ citation needed ]Thus accountability appears to be lacking and perceived as lacking by many Americans [5] so fixing this is necessary. Cultural myths, such as ""the media provides accountability"" arise as a challenge, insofar as they are misleading and act to prevent actions which could promote accountability from being taken.  Finally, a rigorous functional definition shows how an internet-based communication system could restore political accountability, rejuvenating democracy and empowering citizens to govern themselves effectively.In Toni G.L.A. van der Meer, Dave Gelders and Sabine Rotthier's exploratory study on e-Democracy, they conclude that ""governments predominantly utilize the Web to disseminate information. They seem to lack responsiveness, openness, and interactivity, indicating one-way communication or simple interaction despite the Web-based opportunities to facilitate active two-way communication. Sincedialogueis characterized as two-way communication beyond simple interaction, one may conclude that governments do not utilize e-Government to its fullest potential in terms of facilitating and utilizing all dialogue possibilities.""[6]2. People often find it difficult to understand anything newOur cultural myths about politics are many and strong. If a solution doesn't fit into the status quo, it is often difficult for people to understand or accept it. Instead, they may substitute similar ideas they already know, or dismiss it all when it doesn't add up.3. People often believe they can understand something new in a few minutes.PeopleCount's founder has suggested that,""if an idea can't be understood in a few minutes, it has a lesser chance of being adopted, funded, supported. Western culture holds that it's ludicrous to not have a compelling elevator pitch. This is especially true of professional investors and academics who assume their notion of being ""smart"" means they'll quickly understand a new paradigm. People believe it's others' responsibility to be convincing and inspiring, not their own responsibility to understand.""

More on their boards, committees, and advisory bodies can be found on theirwebsite  .Specializations, Methods and ToolsNERC supports “strategic and applied research, survey and long-term environmental observation and monitoring of the whole Earth system,” from the deep Earth and oceans to the atmosphere and space.[4] NERC also provides third-party advice on scientific issues, and evidence for parliament and select committees.[5]Working in partnership with the environmental science community, government, policymakers, public bodies and the general public on how to deliver the science is central to their strategy.[5] For example, NERC held apublic dialogue on geoengineering in 2010  , to help inform policy on supporting geoengineering research. To move beyond communication, NERC aims to meaningfully engage the public to enable informed, evidence-based decisions on the impact of research which will be most relevant for society.[6]Major Projects and EventsA focus of NERC’s public engagement strategy is to use public dialogue to inform NERC. For instance, the “2019 Digital Environment Public Dialogue sought to listen to what diverse groups of people, as stakeholders in research, thought about NERC’s newdigital environment research theme  , led by specialistsHopkins Van Mil  .”[6]Previous public dialogue projects, co-funded bySciencewise  , include:Global food security public panel (2015)UK National Ecosystem Assessment(2015)Space weather dialogue(2013)Public engagement with shale gas and oil(2013)Water Quality and Sustainability(2012)Planet Under Pressure Conference – Youth Voice(2012)Citizens Advisory Forum for Living with Environmental Change(2011)Geoengineering(2010)Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Walter Thompson, which recognized “the benefits of increasing its market knowledge by talking to their customers directly.”[1] After World War II, their priorities shifted from commercial patterns to social problems of the time period, such as rationing, workforce depletion, and wartime communications.[1]Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingTNS-BMRB is part of the Kantar Public network, which provides insights and actionable recommendations to clients, worldwide, based on data and evidence.[2] Led by acting CEO, Ben Toombs, the organization’s senior staff are “acknowledged leaders in the social research sector.”  [3]Specializations, Methods and ToolsAs a public policy research company, TNS-BMRB has conducted large-scale socialsurveysandfocus groupson various topics including work and employment; education; and children and family policy; they work on behalf of government departments, local authorities, and charities.[4] They aim to provide responsive policy evaluation exploring: “policy implementation (formative evaluation); how policy is delivered (process evaluation); what difference the policy makes (impact assessment); and how far the benefits justify the costs (economic analysis).”[5]To this organization, qualitative research is seen as valuable to “evaluate where improvements and efficiencies can be made across public services” by helping government understand the views and priorities of the British public.[5] Therefore, they use in-depth interviews, focus groups, ethnography, deliberation,onlineandvisualmethods, and peer-led research. Kantar Public also aims to “specialize in research with ‘hard to reach’ groups including those on low incomes, the learning disabled, those with mental health issues, black and minority ethnic communities, and children and young people.”[5]Major Projects and EventsTNS-BMRB (now Kantar Public UK) has worked with “prestigious scientific organisations in areas including public engagement, communications, policy development, evaluation, and improving regulation.”[6] One such programme was withSciencewiseand the research councils involved in delivering public dialogue studies on:global food securityandopen data(RCUK),synthetic biology  ,stem cellsand nanotechnology (BBSRC, EPSRC), and geo-engineering for climate change (Royal Society).Analysis and Lessons LearnedWant to contribute an analysis of this organization?

Origins and Development  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Specializations, Methods and Tools  One of the main challenges within the network has been the possibility of having face-to-face meetings, due to the great extension of Argentina's geography. Its work strategies have been based on the use of information and communication technologies , sharing work material online, and implementing virtual sessions. After each meeting, members socialize agreements with their grassroots community or organization.  Major Projects and Events  The National Population and Housing Census 2020 is a process of great importance for indigenous peoples, since its results are the baseline for the formulation of public policies that could benefit indigenous territories in the decade 2020-2030. For the Weaving of Indigenous Professionals, the correct quantification of the population is a prerequisite for the exercise of autonomy in indigenous territories, since the population criterion is the basis for guarantees regarding their own education, health, and medicine, as well as for alternative production models and access to natural resources. In this sense, the adequate identification of the population in each of the indigenous territories is the basis for the exercise of territorial and linguistic rights.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Only members who have been able to pay for their trips to Buenos Aires have been able to attend the consultation meetings with the authorities of the National Institute of Statistics and Census. The National Census of Population and Housing 2020 is a very important process for indigenous peoples, as its results are the baseline for the formulation of public policies that could benefit indigenous territories in the decade 2020-2030.

Hate crimes are committed by perpetrators with the sole intention of targeting victims who belong to a particular social group and discriminating against them on grounds of for example, sexual orientation, expression and gender identity.  Origins and Development  In 2010, Argentina was the first Latin American country to recognize same-sex marriage. Two years later, in 2012, Bill No. 26.791 modified the Criminal Code to punish with life in prison hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation and gender identity. In this context, the Observatory was created by the Anti-Discrimination Institute of the Ombudsman's Office of the City of Buenos Aires, the Argentine LGBT Federation, and the National Ombudsman's Office.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Created by the Anti-Discrimination Institute of the Ombudsman's Office of the City of Buenos Aires, the Argentine LGBT Federation, and the National Ombudsman's Office, the Observatory seeks to monitor violence against the LGBT community and influence the formulation of legislation and public policy regarding the prevention, punishment and eradication of hate crimes against the LGBT community. In its2019 report, the Observatorio Nacional made some urgent recommendationsfor the State which included: integral reform of the Law Against Discrimination; training to the national security forces on topics of human rights, sexual diversity, and non-discrimination; as well as the adoption of nationwide educational campaigns for the LGBT community about their rights and access to public services.

Secondly, it empowers students, allowing them to voice their preferences and to become equal and proactive actors of the educational systems, and to assume responsibility for shaping a dynamic, highly performing, modern and grassroots approach to pedagogic planning, development and implementation.  Lastly, the Council of Students serves as a watchdog against abuse in the educational system, seeking to reinforce compliance with official norms, acting as observers or even mediators at certain times.  As a hybrid system of democratic participation, the Council of Students can be regarded as a complex institution. On one hand, it can be seen as an empowering activist movement, which fosters engagement and action-taking through various platforms of public  deliberation  and consultation. On the other, it is a well-integrated structure, operating alongside the major educational entities of the state apparatus, as a mechanism for bridging the gap between students and decision-makers, spearheading alternative or innovative processes, and overall supporting the advancement of the Romanian educational system.  This grassroots-oriented form of free association, at the pre-university level, became the most notable officially-recognized institution (of the Romanian educational system) which acts, in an unmoderated way, in the best interest of the students, through direct representation and participation across an independent, apolitical and non-religious, network of hierarchically interlinked units. Its primary focus is to ensure the existence of a framework in which students can meaningfully voice their preferences, opinions or ideas, and to generate opportunities for direct contributions towards the construction of a diverse, inclusive, modern and performant educational system, based on the organization’s adherence to universal democratic values and freedoms. The structure, via its fundamental objectives and core missions, seeks to remediate some of the major challenges that have eroded the quality of the educational act in post-communist Romania. As such, the main pillars, which form the Council of Students’ organizational goals, while subsequently addressing specific problems, are:Representing the students, as the principal beneficiaries of the educational processes, and ensuring that relevant administrative and legislative bodies are acting in accordance with their legitimate interests.  Advocating for (and ensuring) the active participation and involvement of students, as equal stakeholders, in decision-making procedures that might affect them.  Monitoring the correct implementation, application, and interpretation of policies related to students’ rights and obligations, while setting measures in place in order to prevent or mediate abuses and conflictual stances.  Facilitating and fostering knowledge exchanges (e.g. know-how, ideas, win-win situations, good practices, etc.), as a way of enabling and further implementation of innovatory and positive development.  Ensuring sub and intra-structural growth (alongside their networks of partners), increasing their capacity for autonomous action-taking and the delivery of positive outcomes in the community. [1]  [2]Origins and Development  The Council of Students, even though it’s a very particular structure, modeled by the specificity of the Romanian society, finds its origins in an international context. In 1975, the city of Dublin saw the creation of OBESSU (The Organizing Bureau of European School Student Unions). This newly founded trans-national representative body reunited a wide array of student unions across the continent (active in general secondary and secondary vocational education) as Member, Candidate or Affiliate Organisations disseminating their practices, ideas, and desires. [3 ] It is exactly this international promotion of multi-organizational forms of democratic innovation and participatory spaces in the educational sector, coupled with the broader (geo)political context of the era, which inspired, and ultimately led to the creation of the (Romanian) Council of Students.  The Romanian students, inspired by the actions of their European peers and having gained new rights and freedoms, shortly after the Romanian Revolution and amidst the democratic transition of the country, started, in 1991, forming various councils in schools across the country. In spite of this fact, it is only close to the beginning of the new millennium that this ""avant-gardist” and western-driven wave of democratic expression, transcended towards a self-statutory organisation.  [4]Consequently, in 1999 the first County Council of Students ( Consiliul Județean al Elevilor – CJE )  was founded, at the students’ request, in Dâmbovița by a group of teachers; 3 years later, the first independent one (entirely managed by students) formed in the city of Cluj-Napoca, with many to follow their example.  [5]Due to an exponential increase in the number of student-led associations, the National Council of Students ( Consiliul Național al Elevilor – CNE)  was formed in 2006 (as a way to unite the emerging movement), integrating 18 out of the 41 existing Counties. In the same year, the first General Assembly took place in the town of Călimănești (24-25th of March), with the participation of two students and one Inspector for Didactic Activities per County; the sessions were moderated by the State Secretary for Pre-University Education Paloma Petrescu.  [6]Following the success of the first General Assembly, the first document regulating the organization and functioning of the Council of Students was approved. Throughout its articles, the administrative order formally acknowledged the structure and regulated its ways of operating, while also putting it under the direct authority of the Ministry of Education, Research and Youth as a ""consultative structure”. [ 7]As a result, the following period (2006-2009) the candidates for the NCS were selected by a commission of School Inspectors, and all their decisions required  a priori  approval by the ministerial cabinet. This situation drastically changed in 2010 with the approval of a new document that enabled:the creation of a CCS in every County, whose development would be facilitated through 8 Regional Council of Students (discontinued after 2015); the creation in every school of a SCS; greater funding allocation and legal jurisdiction; and most importantly, the recognition of its autonomous and independent character.  From there on, with every generation that passed, alongside numerous legislative and administrative orders, aimed at increasing its capacity, autonomy and self-reliance, the structure was fine-tuned and slowly increased its reach, scope and means, evolving into what it is today.[ 8 ]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  A large proportion of the main activities (representation and consultation, through General Assemblies, international forum participation, public discussions, etc.) undertaken by the Council of Students have always been under the auspice of the Ministry of Education and its substructures; funding and support based on unconditional terms, as specified by the law. [9]  [10]  [11 ][ 12 ][ 13 ][ 14] [ 15] [ 16 ]  In recent times, the Council of Students has gained its judicial status, becoming an entity in its own right, meaning that it can generate partnerships, sign contracts of sponsorship, manage funds, or even receive donations (while retaining its non-profit and voluntary character). Analysing all of the secondary activities undertaken by the Council and its substructures (as to observe the range of public and private entities involved into co-organizing, supporting or funding these initiatives) would be impossible. Yet there are a few official partners that have endorsed, for a long time, the activities carried out at the national level, among whom are: UNICEF Romania, OBESSU, Youth Council of Romania, Makosz, Forum Apolum, FITT, The Council for Institutionalized Youths, ANOSR. [ 17]Primary LocationThe Council of Students, at the moment, presents no permanent headquarters or offices from where it conducts its daily operations. Instead, it is decentralized in terms of physical spaces with national General Assemblies (both extraordinary and ordinary ones) across the counties, in an attempt to spread out its reach and on-sight interactions with regional or local actors. In this light, it can be said that the National Council of Students operates inside the official borders of Romania (with very selective and limited external interactions), alongside its county and school substructures. The latter are likely to host their General Assemblies in various venues, available at their respective county seat (42 in total, which are also known as County Capital Municipality/City), across more than 1200 educational institutions across the country (or even at the headquarters of local, regional, and national administrative or legislative bodies).Scope of InfluenceThe geographical scope of the Council of Students varies accordingly to the level of the organization that is used as a measurement, and it presents itself as follows: National and sometimes Regional or International (National Council of Students); Regional and City (County Council of Students); Metropolitan Area (Bucharest Municipal Council of Students); Organization (School Council of Students). While the geographical scope presents fluctuations, the jurisdictional scope remains limited to the Romanian legal structures (including the ones that are shaped in accordance to its adherence to international norms), more precisely the ones which are directly linked or impact the educational system.Legality   The Council of Students, and all of its subsidiaries, operates within clearly defined legal boundaries. Thus, all of their actions and processes are considered to be in line with the legal frameworks that are in place. Even the internal measures, terms and provisions are legally binding in the face of judicial authorities (as long as they do not breach parts of the common law). Also, the members and the structures constitute legal entities with attributes, responsibilities, and rights set in place through various normative acts.StructureThe most basic constituent part is the School Council of Students (mandatory in every educational institution) which consists of a General Assembly and an Executive Office. The former is constituted by internally nominated representatives from all High School and Gymnasium level classes. Its primary function is to act as a decisional forum (which sits as often as necessary), overseeing the implementation of different changes, reaching agreement on different issues and gathering feedback, all through public gatherings, debate and voting mechanisms. The Executive Office, consisting of a President, Vice President(s) and Secretary – that are directly elected from the students, through an election system in one or two turns, based upon the majoritarian vote of all the students of that particular educational institution – manages the activities of the Assembly, moderates sessions, sets the agenda, sets forward proposals, ensure the compliance with internal and national policies, act as spokespersons, initiate extra-organizational cooperation, etc.  [18]All the Presidents (unless their duties have been formally handed over to one of the Vice Presidents) of the School Councils of Students are members of the General Assembly for the County Council of Students, based on their real life territorial-administrative distribution. Their activity is in turn directed by an Executive Office, which is elected through direct majoritarian or preferential vote of the General Assembly, which presents some particularities of its own.All the members of the school Executive Offices can present their candidature for positions in the county Executive Office, after they have been delegated by their own General Assembly. In addition to the President, Vice President(s) and Secretary positions the Executive Offices of the counties have 5 different departments each under the authority of a Director (position open to all students of that county), and have the possibility to create new structures as necessary (e.g. Press Bureau, Assistants etc.). A notable exception is the Bucharest Municipality Council of Students which has Vice-Presidents for each district of the city.  In addition to the General Assembly and Executive Office, the National Council of Students includes two more structures: the National Ethics Commission and Press Bureau. Firstly, the General Assembly represents the decisional core and is constituted from all county Presidents, and 3 Vice-Presidents of the Bucharest Municipality Council of Students. Their activity is coordinated by an Executive Office, which includes a President, 8 Vice-Presidents, Executive Secretary for the Department of Internal Affairs and Executive Secretary for the Department of Education and Communication, all elected, by majoritarian or preferential vote of the National General Assembly, from the ranks of the County Presidents.  The National Ethics Commission is formed by 3 members, directly elected by the National General Assembly, and is open to all the members of the organization regarding their level and alumni. Lastly, more of an auxiliary organism, the Press Bureau, is a structure which undertakes assistance tasks, and, although they can actively participate, they do not possess voting rights in the General Assemblies.They directly respond to the Executive Secretary for the Department of Education and Communication and its members are preselected by the former, on a free-for-all students’ voluntary application basis, and then approved, through majoritarian vote on individual grounds, by the National General Assembly. [ 20 ][ 21 ]FacilitatorsIn its early stages of existence, the Council of Students relied heavily on external facilitators, mentors, and trainers to prepare/guide each generation, set mechanisms in place, and ensure that processes of interaction properly occur. They were usually randomly or voluntarily selected from specially designated academic members (e.g. teachers, school inspectorate, ministry staff, etc.). As time passed, they were replaced by other NGOs' members and an internal alumni network that undertook the task of facilitating, moderating, and mentoring the newcomers. In recent times, this has moved on to on-the-go knowledge, hierarchical facilitation, internally-driven crowd teaching, national guidelines and other forms of intra-organizational preparations; external (non-governmental only) actors being requested only for specific facilitation (e.g. coding, development of new voting patterns, opinion polling, and conducting research etc.).Members and ParticipantsIn terms of the entire population, the Council of Students presents itself as a structure that is limited to students enrolled in primary and secondary education (as they form the core group of the organizations’ activities) – but inside this group, the structure is open to all since it allows the right of participation and involvement in its processes to everyone.  The recruitment of members is done either via elections (which entail different rights of participation and duties) or voluntary involvement (various auxiliary functions); also the right to take part in activities (as an observer) is granted to everyone else and sometimes special requests for involvement are made towards experts, decision-makers, NGO leaders, alumni, etc. The opportunity to take part in elections and their methodology is widely communicated every year across the country through  social media , Ministry of Education, and mass-media; while in terms of secondary activities, in general, they tend to be open to the entire community (e.g. charity works, fundraising,  petitions , arts and crafts etc.).  All of the expenses encountered during the formal activities of the Council of Students are covered (excluding direct payment), while some efforts have been dedicated to enable easier participation of members with rural, disability, economically difficult or ethnic backgrounds (e.g. direct promotion of the structure, suitable changes in the nature of activities, higher expenses covered).  In terms of representativity, being the highest forums of consultation and representation in the education sector (excluding systems of higher education) its participants have been all of the (roughly) 3 million students that are actively enrolled at any given time. The active members would be as follows: 45 at the national level (executive board) with the addition of representatives from all counties at the General Assemblies (in general 2 per county); 10-15 (board) at the county level with as many members as schools represented; and 5-10 members (board) at school level with as many class representatives as necessary. The exact numbers widely differ, but by adding up it would amount to roughly 13,000 members across the country at all levels.All of its members, including the administration staff (e.g. Press Bureau, Executive Office of the National Council, facilitators, trainers, etc.), are students or at least youth (with the small exception of when external stakeholders are involved in those particular activities — NGOs, experts, freelancers, companies etc.), and their work is completely unpaid, the exception being costs related to travels and other small incidentals.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Even though the Council of Students uses a wide array of tools and methods, in order to achieve its goals, they are closely tied to the structural arrangements and revolve around the primary goal: representation. Thus, by looking at how the council approaches the representation of students across the country, one can understand some of the main processes, interactions and methods that are used. This is especially so since the structure is one in which internal interactions are formed through well-defined hierarchical patterns which are centralized around the NCS (both amongst members and organizations), while external action-taking can be regarded as more of a bottom-up approach inside the educational sector  per se .  The executives' main activities are to close the feedback loops by pushing information downwards, monitor activities in schools, offer guidance, interlink organizations, approve activity reports, demote or apply punitive measures for non-compliance, mediate conflicts, realize  petitions , initiate community-wide projects, organize forms of  protest ; this is done using debate, public hearings, interactions with other stakeholders,  focus groups , brainstorming events,  consensus  or majoritarian voting, bargaining with decision-makers, etc.  [19]At the top of the structure, sits the National Council of Students, which unites all of the structures, coordinates their general activities, sets agendas, proposes nation-wide policies, creates or implements internal regulatory changes, acts on the international stage or in relations with governmental bodies, engages with the wider public and private entities, signs inter-organizational cooperation contracts, attracts sponsors, and more.  Ensuring that the G.A. and E.O. activities are conducted in accordance with the existing judicial framework, and signalling any abuses, is the main task of the National Ethics Commission (alongside mediating conflicts, validating documents, or proposing sanctions etc.).ApproachThe Council of Students possesses a wide array of tools that can be used in order to achieve its primary and secondary objectives, the main approach being a peer-to-peer co-governance and voluntary co-production, alongside the Ministry of Education (its subsidiaries and all other structures that have shared competences in this matter). Secondly, by employing internal consultations and direct decision-making, driven by leadership development of students, they are able to approach the state apparatus through the use of various advocacy-driven methods. Lastly, the structure itself fosters the apparition of creative independent actions, limited forms of protests (especially digitally-oriented), evaluation, oversight and  social auditing  in the educational sector or informal engagement with NGOs for co-option in activities. This is due to the fact that the structure is divagating its power as much as possible and all of its structural subdivisions (or even individual members) retain certain degrees of autonomy in terms of engaging in various forms of citizenship or civil society building on its behalf, as they see fit.  Major Projects and Events  In time, across all of its levels, the Council of Students has had numerous achievements ranging from policy changes, budget increases, and gaining rights, all the way to community-driven initiatives, network building, or even influencing positive shifts in the general public's mentality [22] [ 23 ][ 24 ]. It has hosted more than 30 National General Assemblies and thousands of County ones.  In terms of  policy-making , the Council has:created, lobbied, and passed the Students’ Status (ratified through the Order 4742/2016 and published in the Official Gazette, part I, on the 23rd of August 2016) which grants several rights including the students’ voting right in administrative councils[ 25 ][ 26 ]  helped the passing of the Law 38/2019 [ 27]  (and many others) which amends and improves the Law for National Education 1/2011[ 28 ], in regards to student bursaries and other financing, demanded through an open letter for the Government signed by more than 36,000 people [29 ];  initiated the Youths' Resolution in 2016 alongside more than 20 other organisations [30 ];  actively rejected (lately was taken down) the Government Emergency Order 51/2019 [31]Protestand AwarenessIn 2018, the Council started a campaign for the improvement of curriculum, signed by more than 150,000 people. In 2019, it started the movement #emptysheets (offering an empty subject sheet as a sign of personal protest during the national simulations for the baccalaureate and 8th grade exams) which gained national attention[ 32 ]. The Council also organized ""Mourning for Education” a protest aimed at the celebrations for the commencement of the new educational year [33 ]Also in 2018, it presented the RISEN report regarding the real-world situation of school transportation in Romania. [ 34 ]Projects :  The Council organized a national forming session in Cluj-Napoca (2018) which reunited more than 100 newly elected student representatives; realized the Students’ Illustrated Guide (2019), which promotes students’ rights and obligations,and started a promoting caravan in all the major cities of the country; [ 35 ] hosted the National Student Gala [36 ]; sustained the development of the Volunteering Law 78/2014[ 37] ; became a full member into OBESSU [38]  and inspired the creation of a Council of Students in the Republic of Moldova (2013)[ 39 ]; and participated at the European Youth Seminar and EU Youth Conference in Brussels (2019). [40]Analysis and Lessons Learned  The council of Students represents a peculiar hybrid structure and there are some lessons, good practices, and examples that can be learned from it. Being similar to the formats used in  National Public Policy Conferences  (especially the Brazilian one) [41]  and student senates (the  ASUW  one) [42] , the literature surrounding that area also applies to the Council of Students and can be extrapolated (e.g. the works of scholars such as Pogrebinschi, McCabe, Walden or Camden). Similar to them, the Councils' participants are elected; after, their candidacy is approved, with their term duration, responsibilities, and rights varying according to the role they take. Sometimes the election processes represent a challenge as there is a general tendency either for the same person to maintain their position year-after-year due to the fact that they might register high satisfaction rates, already have ensured the support of the majority, present themselves with better experiences compared to newcomers, or there is simply no one else to step up. There has also been the case for high fluidity in terms of position occupancy, this in turn presenting quite a challenge, especially when the Executive Offices are vacated mid-term as it is hard to arrange an effective election and campaigns in the middle of the school year. In general, the duration of the mandate makes candidates and those who occupy positions of leadership in the end think in the short term with respect to revenue; this issue is largely controlled by the National Council of Students, which imposes sets of values, projects, and endeavours to its substructures—which are cross-generational, repetitive, easy to replicate and in general long-term, in order for the activities to have continuity and a high impact rate (e.g. lobbying for an increase in educational budgeting to 6% of the GDP which has been continuously pursued for more than 10 years).  The organization redefines and deploys participatory tools similar to the ones used in mini-publics,  citizens’ summit /panel/ assembly  and public  budgeting ; emphasizing freedom of expression,  deliberation , idea generation, agreement reaching, inclusion, etc. It differs due to its repetitive, formal, and governmentally-linked character. While this is true, the Council ofStudents often uses tools such as  petitions ,  Q&amp;A , or public panels with governmental representatives,  focus-groups , pooling and  online voting , protests, policy-proposals and lobbying or bargaining,  workshops , and more.  It is easy to say from these that it is a traditional form of democratic participation, but the interesting factor lies in the capacity of the organization to strike a balance between formal integration and recognition in the state apparatus and truly voicing and representing its targeted audience. This took the form of a semi-symbiotic relationship with the administrative and legislative agencies. On one hand, the Councils’ legal framework, funding and creation was done by a governmental body, under the pressure of the students demanding freedom of expressions, but on the other it was designed in such a way that the law itself guarded the organization from intervention, co-option or forms of coercion by clearly specifying and regulating institutional interactions. This in turn has led to an organic development of its capacities (similar to other NGOs), alongside its primary consultation and representation functions, whichhelped the structure to become both a relevant partner and actor in the educational sector but also a self-centered organization which is constructing its own pathways to achieve long-term community development both internally and externally.  One of the first challenges faced by the organization was that of striking a balance between formal authorities and integration into the state apparatus and true representativity. This took the form of a semi-symbiotic relationship in which the legal framework and creation was generated by a governmental body, while also funding most of the activity, but it specifically guaranteed it from forms of intervention, co-option, coercion and many others in order to allow for autonomy and capacity of acting and representing while also serving as a platform of consultancy. The main strength which emerges from this initial approach is the fact that the expansion of the structure, its development and its influence have exponentially grown from its apparition (e.g. being mandatory by law for every school to create one led to a sudden burst of them; having meetings with the Minister of Education from the beginning made the structure increase its power of representation quite quickly and allowed it to interact with the state apparatus from the start). The weakness of this design, in terms of democratic processes, is seen during the first years of existence and is represented through mainly a struggle to gain independence, become truly apolitical, avoid interference from governmental bodies.  The closeness with the formal entities can simply be seen as an attempt to copy European developments, by creating a structure which was subordinated to the Ministry of Education almost entirely; it gained through an initial governmental pull-over of resources, significance, influence, reach, know-how, and relevance, the status of partner and consultation forum, only to become more self-reliant over time and completely independent in its actions nowadays (with only funding being gained through it).Spectrum of Public ParticipationIf one were to place the Council of Students inside the IAP2 Spectrum of Public Participation, one could observe that its contributions and interactions fit between the larger descriptions of the Collaborate/Involve categories. This dualistic indexation is primarily due to the fact that the variations occur based on two ever-changing aspects: on one hand, the organizational level that is analysed (e.g. school structures are more likely to collaborate and share power with administrative councils or directors, while county ones might just get involved in the City Hall's decisions), and on the other hand, the nature of the participation act (e.g. due to the wide array of activities, the Ministry or Governmental Agencies might be keen to collaborate towards the development of new assignment methods, but just involve participants on the matter of curriculum or even simply inform of the scheduling of break periods). In this case, it is safe to say that the Council of Students’ public participation, more often than not, revolves around these two broad categories, while acknowledging that itpresents variations which can be, based on their specificity, pinned down almost everywhere on the spectrum.

[Their] unique matching algorithm makes it easy for media, nonprofits and governments to fight polarisation, arguably one of the most important issues facing society today. [They] help break people out of their filter bubbles, build empathy, and work to define common values that strengthen democracy - all with just a conversation” [1].  The goal is to set up a platform where strangers with opposing political views can have one-on-one discussions on common issues [1]. In an age of political polarization and divisiveness, My Country Talks aims to “spark conversations around the world” [2].  Origins and Development  Founded in 2017 by Zeit ONLINE - online edition of the weekly German paper Die Zeit - my Country Talks is a platform and project composed of various series and events.  The political climate at the time of its foundation was characterized by polarization with the election of Donald Trump as president in the USA, the state of Brexit in Britain [3] and the lead up to the German Federal Elections. Therefore, the newsroom proposed the following question: “In times of filter bubbles and polarized discourse, how can we restart the conversation across political divides?” [2]  On May 4, 2017, Zeit ONLINE published a widget on the homepage of its website asking the following question: “May we introduce you to someone?” To outline their political views, the participants answered a brief survey of the following yes-or-no questions:“Has Germany accepted too many refugees?  Should Germany abandon the euro and return to the ""Deutsche Mark""?  Is the West treating Russia fairly?  Was abandoning nuclear energy the right move?  Should homosexual couples be allowed to marry?” [3]Participants were also asked to share their postal codes.  During summer 2017, 12,000 people had registered. As a result, people were paired to meet with strangers that:live within 20 kms of each other  have different political views [4]On June 18, 2017, the first event took place: ""Germany Talks"" or  Deustchland Spricht . In the first edition, 1,200 people across Germany met up in pairs for personal, face-to-face, hour-long political discussions to find common ground between seemingly opposite political views. The event was followed by “100’s of euphoric emails from participants who were thrilled by the opportunity to have an engaging political discussion” [4]. Over three-quarters of the participants provided positive feedback for the following round of events [5].  After the first edition of ""Germany Talks"", the Zeit ONLINE newsroom received extensive national and international media attention by organizations and news outlets expressing interest in replicating the project within their countries to encourage discussion and networks that bridge political divides [2]. As the original team of journalists organized workshops with partners from around the world, the event evolved into an international platform that would be applicable and efficient in the context of various countries [4]. This was followed by a continuation of the Germany Talks series on a national level.  Summer 2018 marked the launch of the software and project called My Country Talks, “which today is a tool that newsrooms, governments, civil society organizations or NGOs can use to start one-on-one discussions in their countries” [4]. As of 2020, “it has been used in more than 10 countries for national events” [4].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The tool is financed partly by Google [4] “and all partners are working on the project in [...] honorary capacity” [6].  The founding team is made of the editor-in-chief of ZEIT ONLINE, Jochen Wegner, along with editors:Maria Exner (Editor-in-Chief of ZEIT Magazin)  Philip Faigle (Special Projects Editor of ZEIT ONLINE)  Sebastian Horn (Deputy Editor in Chief of ZEIT ONLINE) [2]The team includes:Hanna Israel (Project Lead)  Sara Cooper (Technical Project Manager)  Ulrike Zimmerman (Project Manager) [2] Signing upThe website has a “General Terms and Conditions” document that outlines all agreements for “the Good Conversations gGmbH and Organisations (“Partner” or “Partners”) that apply and register for an event under the “My Country Talks” platform. (“Event” or “MCT Event”)” [7].  Satisfying the requirements allows independent media organisations, non-profit organisations or other public interest organisations to become a Partner that can apply to organize an Event with My Country Talks [7].  Partners and SponsorsMy Country Talks is funded by the Federal Foreign Office (foreign ministry of Germany), European Cultural Foundation (Netherlands-based), Allianz Kulturstiftung (for Europe) and Foundation Hippocrene (for Europe) [2].  The program was made possible by the collaboration between Zeit ONLINE and European media organizations. As of October 2021, the following are partners of My Country Talks: Daily Mirror (Britain), Republik (Switzerland), Delfi (Estonia and Latvia), Efimerida ton Syntakton (Greece), Gazeta Wyborcza (Poland), Politiken (Denmark), la Repubblica (Italy), Der Standard (Austria), Helsingin Sanomat (Finland), Arte (France and Germany), HuffPost (USA) bTV Media Group (Bulgaria), LRT.lt (Lithuania), Knack (Belgium), NRK (Norway) [2]. The City University of New York and the Robert Bosch Foundation were also involved in the project [6], however, their role 2019 and onward is unclear.  The first edition of Europe Talks, taking place in 2019, was supported by 17 European media organizations across Europe: bTV Media Group (Bulgaria), Calea Europeana (Romania), Delfi (Estonia and Latvia), De Volkskrant (the Netherlands), Der Standard (Austria), Efimerida Ton Syntakton (Greece), Expresso (Portugal), France24 (France), Gazeta Wyborcza (Poland), HotNews (Romania), Kapital (Slovakia), La Repubblica (Italy), LRT.lt (Lithuania), Mirror (Great Britain), Phoenix (Germany), Politiken (Denmark), Republik (Switzerland) [8].  Europe Talks 2019 was sponsored by the aforementioned sponsors of My Country Talks: Federal Foreign Office (due to the German Presidency of the Council of the European Union 2020 [8]) European Cultural Foundation and Allianz Kulturstiftung. The sponsors also include Stiftung Mercator, the Evans Foundation, Interrail and Centre for Fine Arts Brussels [9] as well as the partnership with the Goethe Institute [8].  Meanwhile, Europe Talks 2020 had 24 sponsors [10].  Specializations, Methods and ToolsSpecializationOn September 28, 2021, an online seminar by Sara Cooper, Technical Project Lead, My Country Talks, and Zeit ONLINE was presented on the International News Media Association (INMA). The webinar was titled “Driving an Innovative Culture in Media to Stay Relevant: Die Zeit's My Country Talks” and they delved into details along with technicalities of their platform [11]. They concluded that “Die Zeit's unique matching algorithm makes it easy for media to fight polarisation, arguably one of the most important issues facing society today” [11].Software and its MethodsMy Country Talks’ software around strategy and design was developed by diesdas.digital - a Berlin-based agency - which describes itself as “the digital-default brand and product studio for leading brands with attitude” [12]. They worked in collaboration with a European group of media organizations: Morgenbladet (Norway), La Repubblica (Italy) and Der Standard (Austria) [4].  With the platform of My Country Talks, “news organisations [are] able to set up their own projects [through] a widget with questions for them to embed, as well as take care of the algorithmic matching, communication and event organisation aspects” [13]. This is done through the “Become a Partner” or “Host an Event” option on the website of My Country Talks [14].  The matching algorithm is tagged “Tinder for Politics” [15]. Based on the participants' answers to simple yes-or-no questions on up-to-date political issues, participants are paired with a partner with whom they share vastly different opinions. In the initial stages of the platform, the partners were also chosen from those living within close proximity. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic the events are being facilitated on digital platforms and the emphasis on location of participants has changed [15].  Major Projects and EventsGermany TalksIn 2018, the year after the first edition of Germany Talks, several more events were organized on the national level, with the intention of achieving visibility and awareness from the public [4].  For the second Germany Talks event, about 20,000 people had registered within only a month [5].Major developments were made after the first edition. For example, the team invited “experts on polarization to analyse the current atmosphere for political discussion in the country” [4] and German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier headed the conference [4]. After 13 My Country Talks national events, the team carried the project across borders.   Europe TalksIn May 2019, Europe Talks was created. My Country Talks evolved into a “pan-European experiment” [9], in which “thousands of participants from across the continent [...] meet for one-on-one conversations to discuss issues that matter to all Europeans” [16].Europe Talks 2019: The first event of the series took place on May 11 as Zeit ONLINE team partnered with 17 European media partners and involved more than 16,200 participants across 33 countries [9].  Europe Talks 2020: The second event of the series was held on December 13 with 24 partners and 12,460 participants from 34 countries [17].  Europe Talks 2021: The third event took place in October 2021 [15].Between 2019-21, My Country Talks organized a record number of events across Europe [15].Germany Talks during the Coronavirus PandemicOn May 10, 2020, another Germany Talks event was organized. 6,500 participants met to discuss the coronavirus pandemic and measures against it - for the first time, via video call. The event was in cooperation with German news outlets: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the Schwäbische Zeitung, the Rheinische Post, Chrismon and evangelisch.de [18].   America TalksMy Country Talks “joined the #ListenFirst coalition of over 300 organizations to develop America Talks, a full-scale, nation-wide event that [took] place as part of the National Week of Conversation” [19]. The partners were USA Today and the USA Today Network, which also promoted participation in the event to its readers across 46 states. Other partners included Yahoo News, AllSides, The Fulcrum and WITF; one of the organizers was Pearce Godwin, founder and CEO of Listen First Project [19].  On June 12-13, 2021, the first America Talks event was held with over 500 participants. On September 20, 2021, America Talks hosted another event to discuss the “impact of infrastructure [...] and explore what [...] representatives in government should do about it” [20] so that results can be shared with Congress.My City TalksOn July 4, 2021, the first My City Talks event took place in Marburg. The “hyperlocal format was created to help people fight polarisation in their city, and bring local government and journalists into conversation with citizens about issues that affect their day-to-day lives” [21]. It was launched on May 17 by the University of Marburg, in cooperation with the Oberhessische Press as well as nonprofit organizations and local community groups [21]. Dr. Thomas Spies, Mayor of Marburg, initiated the event [21].

It has received the following awards: the Jean Monnet Prize for European Integration, the Grimme Online Award, the IPRA President's Award and the Nannen Prize [2].Goals of My Country TalksInternational attention:  The program gained international attention and acclaim; therefore, other countries also adopted the format. In 2018-19, similar programs were held in Austria, Switzerland, Finland, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, and Britain [23]. A major example was on June 10, 2018, when La Repubblica and HuffPost Italia hosted a similar event in La Repubblica's festival located in Bologna [24], which was followed by further events to build up on the initial test.Open debate:  “The ultimate goal is a less polarized debate and a less polarized, more open, and plural public” [25] where people can engage in meaningful discussion on the same topic. Surveys conducted after discussions provide insight into participants changing some of their opinions, being convinced by their partner and answering the same questions differently due to the discussions [26].Respect and safety:  To enable a respectful, natural, and troll-free atmosphere, the team did advance background checks on participants [25].Networking:  As the team worked for the inclusion of different voices, there were many stories of networking and friendship-building between participants.Making an impact:  The goal was not to impact governmental decision making or advocate for certain stances by working directly with the government. Instead, the team of journalists found the solution in acting as the “neutral [and] polite hosts you can trust not to use your data” [25].Receiving and acting on feedback:  The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Based on the suggestions received, most of the events made adjustments for the rest of the series or the following events.Positivity:  The following are the results of a survey after a My Country Talks event:“80% of participants on average say they were happy with their conversation  60% of participants on average say they intend to stay in touch with their conversation partner after the event ends  90% of participants on average give the feedback that they look forward to participating in another MCT event” [27]Publications""General Terms and Conditions for the Organization of a My Country Talks-Event"":https://www.mycountrytalks.org/uploads/Terms-of-Service-My-Country-Talks.pdfSee Also  Social Media accounts of My Country Talks:Twitter:https://twitter.com/mycountrytalks   Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/mycountrytalks/Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/countrytalksYouTube Channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH_560Y9-hGLMW53BiDZPUw About My Country Talks:Monthly newsletter:https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/contactMedium Website:https://mycountrytalks.medium.comTed Talks profile of John Wegner, Editor in Chief of Zeit ONLINE:https://www.ted.com/speakers/jochen_wegnerReferences  [1]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org[2]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/about[3]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/past-events/germany-talks-2017[4]  https://constructiveinstitute.org/how/contributions/how-to-connect-people-in-polarized-communities/[5]  https://www.involve.org.uk/resources/case-studies/my-country-talks[6]  https://www.zeit-verlagsgruppe.de/pressemitteilung/my-country-talks-zeit-online-a-leading-german-news-website-and-respected-international-partners-are-developing-a-digital-platform-for-political-debate/[7]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/uploads/Terms-of-Service-My-Country-Talks.pdf[8]  https://culturalfoundation.eu/stories/europe-talks/[9]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/past-events/europe-talks-2019[10]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/past-events/europe-talks-2020[11]  https://www.inma.org/webinars/driving-an-innovative-culture-in-media-to-stay-relevant-die-zeits-my-country-talks[12]  https://www.diesdas.digital[13]  https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/inside-3-organisations-approach-to-community-minded-journalism/s2/a720367/[14]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/host-an-event[15]  https://mycountrytalks.medium.com/my-country-talks-shortlisted-for-the-nannen-prize-deb3559a1dea[16]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/europe-talks[17]  https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2020-12/europe-talks-debate-opinions-topics-participants[18]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/past-events/germany-talks-2020[19]  https://mycountrytalks.medium.com/america-talks-edc339055ad2[20]  https://americatalks.us[21]  https://mycountrytalks.medium.com/my-city-talks-817f79856a2c[22]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events[23]  https://centerforinterculturaldialogue.org/tag/my-country-talks/[24]  https://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2018-06/l-italia-si-parla-bologna-my-country-talks-english[25]  https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/08/in-germany-a-news-site-is-pairing-up-liberals-and-conservatives-and-actually-getting-them-to-gasp-have-a-civil-conversation/[26]  https://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/2021-09/germany-talks-debate-election-germany-data-participants-english[27]  https://www.mycountrytalks.org/events/impactExternal LinksDocuments by My Country Talks:Privacy Policy for the website mycountrytalks.org:http://www.mycountrytalks.org/privacy-policyPrivacy Policy for Europe Talks:https://www.mycountrytalks.org/europe-talks-privacy-policyTerms of Service and DPA (General Terms and Conditions for the Organization of an My Country Talks-Event):https://www.mycountrytalks.org/terms-of-serviceImpressum Good Conversations:https://www.mycountrytalks.org/imprintUpdates on My Country Talks:https://linktr.ee/mycountrytalksResponsibilities and Experience of “Project Lead for My Country Talks”:https://zeit-verlagsgruppe.softgarden.io/job/6777281?l=deArticles about My Country Talks:Financial Times article:https://ig.ft.com/europe-talks/Article by the website of Goethe Institute - a sponsor:https://www.goethe.de/en/kul/ges/21497299.htmlScientific study about My Country Talks:https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2019-08/armin-falk-germany-talks-behaviour-research-englishInterview published on My Country Talks:https://mycountrytalks.medium.com/an-interview-with-david-broockman-1283c80e65c5Notes ",1,0,4,2,0,,"My Country Talks is an international platform for political dialogue.

It is Marxist in orientation and has a national reach [1]. Specifically, it seeks to expand the capacity of  communal councils  and related institutions to achieve an economy self-managed and self-governed by peasants and workers.  According to their website:  “[t]he CRBZ is a space for participation and meeting of any person who wants to fight for the construction of a more just and democratic society, for the good life of the people and a better world, which necessarily implies the construction of a different alternative to the capitalist system.”[2].  The mission of the CRZB is to deepen the revolutionary transformation in the Venezuelan countryside by organizing peasant take-overs of unused land and organizing cooperative and communal structures. Often it organizes peasant communities against retaliatory violence from landlords and corrupt elements of the state bureaucracy.  Origins and Development  The CRBZ is composed of four constituent organizations: the Ezequiel Zamora Peasant National Front; the Simon Bolivar National Communal Front; Workers Popular Power Movement; and the Centre for Training and Social Study Simón Rodríguez. The first two have been active in land-occupations and the construction of  communal councils . The CRBZ has a national reach, organizing in in dozens of rural Venezuelan states like Guarico, Apure, Lara, and Barinas.  The Ezequiel Zamora Peasant National Front is the oldest part of the CRBZ. In 1998 and 1999 it was working with rural people to organize agrarian reform [3]. The 2001 Land and Agricultural Development Law enabled this organization to undertake lawful occupations of unused land [4]. In one instance, the Ezequiel Zamora Peasant National Front organized the occupation and re-starting of production of part of a farm previously expropriated by the state to distribute to landless peasants. In this way they immediately attained 500 hectares of land, machinery, and financing to organize a local cooperative [1].  In 2005 the Ezequiel Zamora Peasant National Front grouped together 350 popular democratic communal councils to build the Simon Bolivar National Communal Front as a popular democratic to the existing state and capitalist economy. One organizer describes their first steps in the following way:  “We began our communal work in the state of Apure, a very difficult area to do grassroots organizing because of thefts, contraband, irregular forces that exist along the border (with Colombia), paramilitaries, and assassinations carried out by local elites. There in Apure we got started. The first thing we did was to bring together 39 communal councils and form eight communes. Once that was accomplished, we formed the country’s first communal city, now known as the Simon Bolivar Socialist Campesino Communal City (CCCS-SB).” [3]  While the origins of the CRBZ pre-date the election of Hugo Chávez, it’s membership and organizing of popular democratic institutions exploded under the reforms of the Bolivarian Revolution. Today, the CRBZ is a permanent feature of the Bolivarian process that organizes cooperatives, communal councils, and collective production. Thus in working with the legal frameworks established by the government, the CRBZ evolved over time from a national peasant organization into one that uses  communal councils  to build an alternative to both oil dependence and a bureaucratic state rooted in participatory democracy.  Historically, Venezuela has been an importer of food due in part because of the oil economy and land ownership was extremely concentrated. Drawing from the discourse of food sovereignty and re-engaging in production, the CRBZ uses popular democracy to address the issues of food scarcity and rural inequality in land ownership.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The CRBZ has central structures of spokespeople who coordinate activities nationally. Within their communal wing, affiliated communal councils operate within the legal regulations established by the Special Law on Communal Councils, the Organic Law of the Communes, and the Organic Law on the Communal Economic System [5]. In this respect, the highest decision making in the neighbourhood level is in the Citizen Assembly with elected spokespeople appointed to manage day-to-day activities. Chapters exist throughout Venezuela.  Start-up funding for cooperative and communal production initiatives, as well as technical assistance, have historically come from the Ministry of Agriculture, the National Institute of Rural Development (INDER), the National Institute of Lands (INTI), and the National Institutefor Agricultural Health [1]. Additionally, the INITI is the legal organ responsible for transferring ownership of occupied lands. These state organs have been denounced by activists for the bureaucratic and corrupt way they are run and delays in grants agrarian charters to legalize occupied land [4,6]. Conflicts have included marches and office occupations.  At a grass-roots level, ultimate decision making on financial issues is made by the Citizen’s Assemblies of each communal council and commune. Each communal council appoint sits own members to run a Unit of Financial Administration that makes day-to-day management decisions over finances [5]. At the level of the commune, each communal council elects a spokesperson to a Communal Parliament which approves a Communal Development Plan. Each commune has a Communal Bank that manages financing to realize the plan.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The CRBZ plays a catalyzing role in organizing communal councils, setting up social owned production, and expanding participatory democracy into the economy and politics of the areas where they organize. It creates participatory communal councils through organizing land occupations and re-igniting food production. Activities use to achieve this include neighbourhood assemblies, community censuses, community elections, participatory planning, participatory budgeting, co-managed farms, and co-managed municipalities [7].  Major Projects and Events  The CRBZ has organized several major projects including Simon Bolivar Socialist Campesino Communal City and the establishment of new communal councils throughout Venezuela. Additionally it has participated in the 2017 National Constituent Assembly and the 2018 Admirable Campesino March [8].  Analysis and Lessons Learned  The CRBZ has pursued a dual strategy of building communal councils as expressing participatory democracy while running candidates for the United Social Party (PSUV) in municipalities where they actively organize [1]. This strategy is described by Dario Azzellini as two track construction of socialism [1]. CRBZ spokespeople have said this works well as they use the municipal offices to buttress the decisions made by participatory institutions [9].

Their central goal is to establish socialism in Venezuela on the basis of democratizing economic production [1]. They aim to do this by beating the economic war against Venezuela by reviving idle state-owned workplaces with the active participation of working class people. Dubbed  Productive Workers’ Battles , the EPO aims to revive idle factories by promoting  workers’ councils  while empowering workers through participatory education and volunteer-work to run their own workplaces.  Origins and Development  The EPO was established in 2016. It traces its roots to the factory occupations of the Indorca , Calderys , and EQUIPETROL factories in the Guyana industrial region. These occupied plants were nationalized by the state but re-activated and operated by the workers themselves. In 2016, workers from these plants were invited to engage in the first  Productive Workers’ Battle  to re-start production at a fish-processing plant across the country [2]. The EPO led volunteer brigades that took direction from workers’ councils but solicited aid from workers with specialized knowledge across Venezuela. After a series of successful factory re-starts the state began materially supporting these initiatives by appointing lead organizers to head state-owned corporations aiming to re-start production [3]. Under this period the volunteer network of workers striving to re-start production nationally crystallized into the autonomous yet revolutionary EPO.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Members were initially drawn from the  Indorca , Calderys , and EQUIPETROL factories. The area where they are concentrated is known for long histories of militant unions and radical  strikes  [4]. Overall the EPO has become a volunteer labour network with dispersed operating areas drawing on participants from public and privately owned factories [1][2]. The  Productive Workers’ Battles  organized by the EPO had state funding for a short period of time, however, conflict over participatory organizing tactics caused friction with state funders [5]. The lack of state funding and the COVID-19 pandemic has decisively slowed down EPO organizing.  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The EPO facilitates a network of volunteer machinists and engineers through  workers’ councils  to revive state-owned factories that have become idle. Working with grassroots workers in councils is part of their concerted strategy to build socialism on the basis of democracy in the economy.  Major Projects and Events  The EPO labels every event of re-starting production at an idle factory as a  productive workers’ battle . Through these events, the EPO aims to build self-esteem and self-organization of workers – who once struggled for the nationalization of their factories, yet now were looking at the prospect of their workplaces being abandoned.

Our light central structure and ability to innovate and adapt mean that EPD is ideally placed to make a difference in a changing, dynamic and unpredictable world. Our collective strength allows us to understand the evolving challenges in political systems and democratic governance, to build evidence of what works - and what doesn’t - and to tackle programmes in ways that respond to the complexity of the challenge.  EPD has direct insight and hands-on experience of the various dimensions of democratic governance that must work in parallel in a functioning democracy. This is because we bring together organisations with a solid track-record, vast external reach, strong relationships with key domestic actors and specialisations of working on:different fields of democracy support : media support, civic tech, political parties, local authorities, elections, the rule of law, women’s participation, parliamentary support, multi-stakeholder dialogue, political and civil rights, civil society capacity building, ICT and civic and political education;different levels of society : political leadership, elected representatives, state officials, civil society and grassroots community representatives.We work with state and non-state actors in Europe and abroad. EPD brings this expertise together in order to combat the traditional approach of working in silos. This wealth of knowledge means that EPD is a veritable centre of expertise for democracy support.  Through focusing on the whole of the democratic system, EPD is also able to look at the links between actors rather than just the actors themselves. These links are frequently missed even if it is clear that changes in one element of the system produce intended and unintended ripple effects on other parts of the system.  It is also through this diverse knowledge and experience that EPD is able to take a bird’s eye view of the challenges affecting democracy and provide analysis and research for the benefit of all those supporting democracy around the world. From our headquarters in Brussels we centralise information from around Europe and likewise feed information from Brussels to European states through our members. We have proven that we can make a difference in the policy space based on the evidence from our research and our field experience.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  EPD is conceived as a “Community of practice“. That is, a group of organisations which work together because, by doing so, they can substantially improve the way they operate in the realm of democracy support. This notion does not only apply to EPD as a network and its institutional development, but also to all the actions and partnerships constructed under the EPD banner.  The following organisations are members of EPD and have signed the EPD statutes. All members take part in the General Assembly that governs the organisation and where seven members are elected to the EPD Board for a period of 2 years. From these 7 board members, a President, Vice-President and Treasurer are elected for the duration of the 2-year period.Article 19  CFI Media Development  Danish Institute for Parties and Democracy (DIPD)  Democracy Reporting International  Demo Finland  EDGE  Elbarlament  Election Watch  European Association for Local Democracy (ALDA)  European ExchangeePaństwo FoundationNetherlands Helsinki Committee  Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy (NIMD)  Oslo Center  People in Need  Catholic University of Portugal  Westminster Foundation for Democracy  World Leadership Alliance - Club de MadridEPD main sources of funding are reported  here .  Specializations  EPD’s uniqueness as an organisation is our horizontal and vertical coverage of the key players within a democratic system and our ability to straddle the academic, policy and practitioner worlds. Our ability to innovate and adapt, means that we are ideally placed to make a difference in a changing, dynamic and unpredictable world. Our toolkit for working on our multi-annual priorities is based on the three pillars constituting the core of the EPD approach: knowledge, advocacy and programmes.Advocacy:  We actively work towards improving democracy support policies and advising on foreign policies that can reinforce democracy in the face of global challenges. Through our head office in Brussels, we play a key role in contributing to improving democracy support policies, working closely with EU institutions, European governments, and building civil society coalitions together with our partners.Programmes : We bring together the expertise of specialists from various sectors of democracy support (parliaments, parties, elections, human rights, media, executive leadership, ICT etc.) on joint programmes in which we apply our in-house methods for creating political dialogue and behavioural changes. EPD and its members’ programmes focus on Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.Knowledge : We push the boundaries of democratic thinking and facilitate the exchange of experiences and lessons learned amongst practitioners from different sectors of the democracy support community. Our research investigates gaps in the democracy field and helps us inform our advocacy work.ApproachesThe members of EPD have come together to create various joint approaches that make the most of the  comparative advantage of the network  . Due to the expertise from different sectors and the variety of experience in terms of partners, EPD is able to take a more holistic approach to democratic development. All the  constituent elements of a political system are interlinked  and it is therefore paramount for links to be made between specialists from different fields of democracy support. EPD has developed different joint approaches that are implemented around the world, either stand alone or within other projects. You can find out more by clicking on the links below.INSPIREDis a method of policy dialogue that aims to promote transparency and accountability by guiding policy dialogue through three phases: collective assessment, consensus-building, and monitoring . In particular, it encourages international aid organisations and practitioners to make use of policy dialogue, by enhancing its inclusiveness and putting in place participatory mechanisms that make it more representative and legitimate. Its main assumption is that policies that have been elaborated taking into account different interests and view points are more likely to resist sudden changes in the balance of powers than policies that benefit only a small ruling elite.SPACEis a 3-step approach that has been developed to design programmes and projects that contribute to creating space for civil society, drawing on the unique mix of skills and expertise of 18 European organisations that support democracy in more than 100 countries worldwide.  It starts out with a Democratic Institutions for a Conducive Environment (DICE) assessment aimed at creating a better understanding of how democratic institutions drive or hinder the development of civil society space in the country. DICE is tailored to the local context, as it uses tools for stakeholder mapping and Political Economy Analysis (PEA) to identify opportunities for influencing positive change.PublicationsThe Digital-Democracy-Development Nexus: How to effectively advance the EU’s Digital Policy abroad , EPD, 2021Toward a New Era of European Support to Political Party Systems , EPD, 2021Thinking Democratically: A Comprehensive Approach to Countering and Preventing ""Shrinking Space"" , EPD, 2020Programming for Democracy: A how-to guide for different areas of democratic support , EPD, 2020Louder than words?

[1]  They do this through organizing training programs, community outreach, and mobilizing for protests among youth aged 15 to 35. GYEM seeks environmental sustainability which involves clean air and water, sustainable food and energy, and protected lands and oceans for posterity. [2] They believe young people are well-skilled for environmental campaigning because they are most vulnerable to environmental damage and climate change.  Origins and Development  The groundwork for GYEM’s formation began in the year 2010 with their first campaign in 2012. This group was started by a group of young activists led by Gideon Commey, a young activist who had embarked on environmental sanitation campaigns at the University of Ghana Campus and the Accra community. Upon seeing the eroded shores of Keta, Ghana, as a result of rising sea levels in the area, he decided to take action on climate and environmental policy in Ghana. [3]Gideon Commey, along with Newton Abubakar Zico, Abdulai Abubakr, and Mariama Sawodogo Kareem established the Ghana Youth Environmental Movement in Madina, Accra. [4]  Meetings were first held in pubs and bars. However, these venues became too expensive to continue holding meetings, leading them to gather in the homes of founding members with family support until they secured an office space in 2018. [5]  By 2012 they had a first official meeting to adopt a framework and constitution, then came up with the name Ghana Youth Environmental Movement (GYEM). The organization grew by drawing from online networks from previous non-environmental activist projects the founding members had engaged in such as “Share-your-lunch Ghana”. [6]On November 7, 2012, they engaged in their first non-violent campaign where they “gatecrashed” the inauguration of the National Environmental Policy on November 7, 2012, to express their exasperation with the “conferences, summits, the teas, and committees that were lacking in commensurate action” [7]  With placards, masks, and t-shirts with the inscription “IMPLEMENT THE POLICY”, they attracted attention from the government officials and other dignitaries at the event.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  GYEM is comprised of a 7-member board of advisors, an 8-member management team and a steering group with members representing the Ahafo, Ashanti, Bono, North East, Oti, Bono East, Central, Eastern, Greater Accra, Volta, Western, Western North. Northern, Savannah, Upper East, and Upper West regions of Ghana. [8]  Membership of GYEM is completely voluntary, however, they target both rural and urban youth from the ages of 15-35 across the country. The group currently has over 500 registered members across Ghana. [9]Some of their past projects were mainly funded by grants from partnering organizations such as the International Secretariat for Water (ISW) and  t he Business Sector Advocacy Challenge (BUSAC) Fund.  Membership dues also support the running of the organization.  Specializations, Methods, and Tools  GYEM uses non-violent campaigns to petition the government to take favorable environmental policy. Some of these non-violent campaigns take the form of direct action, where they occupy buildings such as the ministry of energy, environmental protection agency, and the like, press conferences, and walks through the city with banners and placards. Their main goal is environmental advocacy, which also includes social media activism.  Their projects are also facilitated through partnerships with environmental groups such as A Rocha Ghana, Hipsters of Nature, Green Africa Youth Organisation, Institute for Sustainable Energy and Environmental Solutions, Let’s do it Ghana and Mother of all Nations Foundation. They connect with these groups through social media and other informal networks. This coalition-building is facilitated by joint meetings followed by what they describe as an organic way of working together because of their common mission.  Major Projects and Events  GYEM has carried out several non-violent protests based on national and global environmental issues; some initiated by the group and others in support of other groups that they partner with.  In 2016, they embarked on a “No Coal Campaign” in which they occupied buildings at the Ministry of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency in Ghana to protest a deal between the Government of Ghana and the Shenzhen Energy Group to establish a 700MW supercritical coal-fired power plant, at Ekumfi Aboano in the Central region of Ghana, sourcing coal from South Africa. This campaign was carried out to prevent coal, a harmful fossil fuel, from being introduced into Ghana’s energy mix.Current ProjectsThey are currently also starting a new project called the “Single-Use Plastics Campaign” geared at pushing the government to rid Ghana of single plastic use.  They are currently supporting A Rocha Ghana’s “Save Atewa Campaign” aimed at stopping the Ghanaian government from mining bauxite in the rich Atewa forest in the Eastern Region of Ghana.  Besides these non-violent campaigns, GYEM also organizes training for young people in Environmental Advocacy through their year-long Ghana Young Environmentalist Programme and their Green Clubs in Schools Project in partnership with swiss universities Science Action in Schools for Sustainable Development (SAS4SD) Consortia for Education and Research. Their annual flagship program “Powershift” brings together young people across Ghana to discuss an environmental issue in Ghana and possible responses to it.  [10]   GYEM also engages in community outreach projects, such as the “Kyensu” (an Akan Word for “Share water”) where they built a water kiosk in Treba- a peri-urban community in the Greater Accra region with perpetual water shortage to satisfy this need. [11]Analysis and Lessons Learned  GYEM has a strong skill for partnership formation. Most of their projects are carried out with support from other renowned non-profit organizations. Their activism is also very wide-ranging considering that they do not only “hit the streets” to advocate for better environmental policies from the government, but also take the initiative to solve environmental problems through projects like “Kyensu” and the Green Schools project.  The presence of a steering committee across all the regions in Ghana presents them with the opportunity to influence a wider audience in fairly rural parts of Ghana. However, the voluntary nature of the group makes it difficult to have strong branches outside Ghana’s capital, Accra. 500+ members is a large number, but it appears hard for the leadership of GYEM to determine what percentage of this membership is active in pursuing their mission  .Publications  GYEM’s publications can be found on their  website·GYEM partners SAS4SD in a 2-year ‘Green Clubs in Schools Project:https://gyemgh.org/blog/gyem-partners-sas4sd-in-a-2-year-green-clubs-in-schools-project.html·The 2020 Goldman Environmental Prize for Africa: Setting the Record Straight – Facts about Ghana’s Coal Campaign (2013-2016) &amp; Problems Arising from the Current Narrative:https://gyemgh.org/blog/the-2020-goldman-environmental-prize-for-africa-setting-the-record-straight-facts-about-ghanas-coal-campaign-2013-2016-problems-arising-from-the-current-narrative.htmlContact informationEmail  :  info@gyem.org  /  gyemgh@gmail.comTwitter:@gyemghFacebook:Ghana Youth Environmental MovementInstagram:gyemghAddress :  Hse No. 163 Racecourse Street, Tabora-Accra, GhanaPhone number :  +233 (0) 541 295 774  See Also  Ghanaian Youth Keen on Saving the Environment :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTQuXd3f8LcGYEM TV Environmental Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/user/GYEMGH  Footnotes[1]  “GYEM Ghana.”[2]  “GYEM Ghana.”[3]  Commey Gideon,  Making a Change, a Comprehensive Guide for Leaders  (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform), 2017.on}[4]  Asamoah-Gyadu, “On the Frontlines.”[5]  Commey Gideon,  Making a Change, a Comprehensive Guide for Leaders  (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform), 2017.[6]  “(2) Share-Your-Lunch Ghana | Facebook.”[7]  “ Commey Gideon,  Making a Change, a Comprehensive Guide for Leaders  (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform), 2017.

The term  BudgIT  is a hybrid of budget and information technology.,0,2021-09-06,2022-01-17,421308,"""Oyinade Adekunle""",https://participedia.net/user/421308,418161,"""Pan Khantidhara Participedia Team""",https://participedia.net/user/418161,en,55 Moleye Street,,Lagos,Lagos,101212,Nigeria,6.5021683,3.3778238,non_profit_non_gov,multinational,,,community, evaluation, public,manage, facilitate, inform,government_spending, government_transparency, sustainable,planning, science, economics,," Mission and PurposeEstablished in September 2011, BudgIT seeks a transparent relationship between the government and the governed by applying technology to intersect citizen engagement with institutional improvement and facilitate societal change. The Nigerian budget remains a thick document with dismal performance, especially in capital projects implementation.  [1]  Cases of poor data management and analysis in the Nigerian government have continued to affect government projects’ accuracy and hinder accountability and transparency of government operations.  [2]To tackle this, BudgIT’s services are classified into four: “providing simplified access to budgets and public finance data; project monitoring for efficient service delivery; promoting accountability and fiscal inclusion in the extractive industries, and collaboration with government and stakeholders such as media and civil society institutions.  [3]  Origins and DevelopmentIn February 2011, Co-Creation Hub (a technology-oriented centre dedicated to social capital acceleration to ensure development in various spheres) organized a 48-hour Tech-In-Series event.  [4]  The BudgIT team emerged second of the three contenders where they came up with the idea for open data access of government spending for public knowledge. As part of its reward, Co-Creation Hub provided BudgIT with financial resources and office space to carry out its projects. In 2019, with Oluseun Onigbinde and Joseph Agunbiade as co-founders of BudgIT, BudgIT metamorphosed from two to thirty full-time staff and twenty-nine project tracking officers charged with monitoring budgetary activities in 33 states in Nigeria.  [5]  The annual budgets (state and federal) contain projects that meet the basic amenities required by Nigerians, such as road network, electricity, water supply, healthcare facilities, and education. BudgIT seeks to promote accountability and transparency in government budgets and expenditures through its published reports and infographics by providing a platform for Nigerians to access Nigerian budgetary activities. Nigerian States experience human development issues such as poverty, unemployment, underemployment, avoidable disease outbreaks (excluding COVID -19), and a host of third-world problems. The disease outbreaks include cholera, monkeypox, measles, Cerebro-spinal meningitis, Lassa fever, and Yellow fever. According to BudgIT, to solve these issues, each state needs to be a sustainable subnational entity. Each state should generate enough revenue to meet its capital and recurrent expenditure.  [6]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingBudgIT is headed by Gabriel Okeowo (Chief Executive Officer),  Oluseun Onigbinde (Director), Joseph Agunbiade (Technology Lead), and Mercy Titus (Finance Lead).  [7]  There are thirty full-time staff and interns are sourced from the National Youth Service Corps(NYSC), a one-year mandatory service for Nigerian graduates. The Research and Advocacy department comprises seven people charged with research, data spreading, data analysis, policy advocacy, and budget analysis. For full-time positions, the recruitment process is need-based in which an advert is put out on its social media platforms. Applicants are interviewed and asked scenario-based questions to emphasize skills and capacity rather than academic qualifications and experience.  [8]    The volunteers referred to as community champions are available in the thirty-three states with BudgIT visibility. There are also service delivery trackers of about 15,000 who conduct field investigations of government projects in various states. Its social media accounts (Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook) boast thousands of followers, creating awareness on government projects in their respective communities. Physical offices are situated in Nigeria (Lagos and Abuja), Ghana, and Sierra Leone.  [9]  The availability of funds plays an influential role in ensuring the success of projects and the attainment of objectives. BudgIT’s financial capability has evolved through grants (primarily international) and donations. The Tony Elumelu Foundation and Co-Creation Hub supported BudgIT’s project execution in the first six months of its establishment. In 2013, BudgIT’s total revenue from grants, consulting, and competitions were 34.9 million Naira (US$96,600). In 2014, BudgIT received up to  $400,000  in grants from Omidyar Network, while MacArthur Foundation  awarded $550,000  between 2018 and 2019.  [10]  Other financial partners include The Global Health Advocacy Incubator (GHAI), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Oxfam, The Indigo, Luminate, Ford Foundation, Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA), and United Nations Democracy Fund (UNDEF).  [11]  Also, BudgIT seeks donations through its “Donate” option on its official website  -https://yourbudgit.com/. To maintain its non-partisan position, BudgIT has avoided local funding opportunities from individuals and organizations.Specializations, Methods and ToolsBudgIT implements community-driven development and community monitoring methods in achieving its vision. On the one hand, community-driven development “empowers participating citizens and communities to control the development process, resources, and decision-making to address their self-identified needs.  [12]On the other hand,    community monitoring features local population as a check on the implementation of government projects through oversight and reporting of service quality, efficiency, and efficacy.  [13]  Following its vision: “to see a community of active citizens that relentlessly make effective use of public information to demand accountability, geared for institutional improvement, efficient services delivery, and an equitable society”  [14]  BudgIT has adopted tools that endeavors to simplify Nigerian budgets and public data to aid understanding and accessibility across every literacy span. These tools include citizen reporting, monitoring platforms, town halls, direct advocacy, infographics, public rallies, data sourcing, and analysis carried out at Federal, State, and local levels. BudgIT makes use of Traka, a project-tracking tool for investigating the implementation and execution of government projects. It allows individuals to register complaints about abandoned or dysfunctional infrastructure projects in and around their communities. Tracka is visible in thirty-two states in Nigeria, excluding Jigawa, Yobe, Borno, and Zamfara due to their poor audit process.  [15]According to Oluseun Onigbinde, “tech tools have enabled us to scrutinize the budget and, melded with boots on the ground, curate the status of projects.”  [16]Also, BudgIT collaborates with startups, civic organizations, encouraging civic responsibility and tackling injustice using technology tools.    There is also the collaboration with the National Assembly Budget and Research Office; and the Budget Office of the Federation. In 2013, BudgIT worked with 28 civil society organizations and presented the Nigerian budget at 32 civil society sessions. In 2017, the organization had 55 civil society partners and implemented new public communications tools, including e-tools, SMS, a regular radio program, and social media. In summary, its services are carried out through community outreach, technological initiatives, digital organizing, workshops, citizens engagement, mentorship programs, and policy advocacy.  Major Projects and EventsBudgIT activities are implemented in five stages: data mining, data verification, creative display, sharing and feedback through  fiscal analyses, civic technology, and data representation. Citizen reporting allows Nigerians to submit a report on government projects within their communities. To ensure the accuracy of data provided to citizens, BudgIT collaborates with relevant government agencies such as the National Bureau of Statistics, Debt Management Office, Nigerian Centre for Disease Control. The project execution begins with project selection, which starts with internal conversations, data analysis by state, and available funds. The project is assigned to a full-time staff to serve as a team lead and deployment of service delivery trackers to state(s) involved in the project. The service delivery trackers carry out offline and online engagements such as town-hall meetings, engagement in schools/universities, and collaboration with stakeholders. The BudgIT team investigates stories submitted, and its reports are published on its social media platforms and reported to government agencies to ensure that contractors involved are held accountable. After investigation, BudgIT provides government agencies and the populace with its report through Tracka and social media platforms. In each report, loopholes in the project are identified, and solutions are proffered to ensure project completion as stated in the budget.Perhaps, the most effective tool deployed by BudgIT is Tracka, a community-based tool with active citizens tracking the implementation of government projects in their community to ensure service delivery. Tracka can be used in two ways- to track existing projects and to uphold investigative reports on government projects. To track existing projects, BudgIT created a website with a database of government projects which can be searched by sector (education, health, transport) or category (Federal government budgets, State budgets). The status of each project is updated based on “not stated,” “in progress,” “abandoned,” and “completed.” Tracka provides a platform for Nigerians to post pictures of developmental projects in their communities. BudgIT’s project officers aid citizens offline to communicate with their elected representatives and demand completion of the government projects in their neighborhoods.  [17]Tracka’s Project Tracking Officers (PTOs) and Community Champions are assigned to their various communities to investigate government projects and present reports.In November 2020, Tracka, with support from Ford Foundation, kickstarted the community-based civic advocacy project in 24 selected communities across six oil-producing states in the Niger-Delta region. Among other objectives, the project promoted citizen engagement for the beneficiation of natural resources and service delivery. The project team has tracked one hundred and fifty-four (154) projects in the 2020 states’ budget, the Niger Delta Development Commission Budget (NDDC), 2020 Consolidated Capital Projects, and 2020 Zonal Intervention Projects. Of the 154 projects, 60 have been completed, 36 are currently ongoing, 27 have not begun, and 15 are abandoned due to respective agencies’ late release of funds due to the pandemic.  [18]The Covid’19 pandemic affected Nigerians economically due to the loss of jobs and the inability to meet basic needs. BudgIT initiatedCovidFundTraka  to track Covid-19 donations received by Nigeria’s federal and state governments; and 2020 allocations tagged for “COVID-19 response” in each state’s 2020 revised budget. These include allocations for a direct response within and outside the health sector that categorized budget allocations based on state recipient, amount, item, expenditure, type (recurrent or capital), and the specific agency that receives the money.  [19]In 2021, using six states (Niger, Lagos, Kano, Ogun, Enugu, and River) and government agencies as case studies, BudgIt released a report titled “COVID-19 Fund: Fiscal Support, Palliative Analysis &amp; Institutional Response” that reviewed Nigeria’s current fiscal support and institutional response to COVID-19.  [20]  In 2013, BudgIT supported Enough Is Enough (a prominent civic society organization in Nigeria) in the #OpenNass campaign, pushing the National Assembly to create and release a budget of its expenditures. Town halls and public rallies were organized, and citizen petitions were collected and sent to the National Assembly to demonstrate support for transparency. In 2017, the government yielded to the campaign in greater detail than in the past by releasing its past budgets.  [21]      In 2017, BudgIT’s Fix Our Oil campaign altering the lines of authority in issuing petroleum licenses coincided with the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill’s hearings. Along with various “tweet meets” and social media engagements, the organization produced a series of infographics about the bill’s benefits, limitations, and the Nigerian National Petroleum Company budget. This led to the passage of the bill in May 2017 by the Senate.  [22]In 2018, the BudgIT-led conference explored innovative avenues to leverage new media tools towards a progressive democratic society and an electoral system devoid of corrupt practices. The expected outcome was an improved understanding of how new media can advance governance and accountability. In Sierra Leone, BudgIT began ‘BudgIT Hour,’ a bi-weekly civic engagement radio show. The one-hour show airs on the community radio station, Lion Mountain. It plans to host another program on Victory Radio (with a wider national audience) to engage local councils on governance.  [23]Trackaplus  , a program produced by BudgIT in collaboration with a popular Nigerian television station, Channels Television, has been able to successfully find and report on abandoned projects in many communities, particularly on infrastructure projects that have been abandoned.Upon analysis of the 2020 budget, BudgIT successfully ensured the reduction of bloated budget and unnecessary expenses channeled to the provision of basic amenities for the Nigerian population. In 2021, BudgIT made recommendations regarding the wasteful and frivolous items in the National Budget, which successfully removed over 200 items of about 35 billion Naira.  [24]For example, BudgIT exposed a 41 million naira (US$113,575) investment that claimed to be funding a non-existent youth center in Kebbi State. BudgIT mobilized civil outcry on public pay levels by encouraging careful public review of the budget, resulting in a public servant salary cap.In some cases, BudgIT experienced hostility from government officials, especially those indicted due to reports by BudgIT. There is also a threat to the life and safety of staff who are more cautious in their activities. Some staff are arrested, beaten, or captured by the Department of State Services (a security agency in Nigeria), victims of accidents, and kidnapping in remote areas where projects are located. This explains the absence of pictorial representation of staff members on the BudgIT website.  [25]BudgIT ensures simplification of Nigeria’s budgetary information to ease understanding by its citizens. Others include promoting accessibility, accountability, ensuring the provision of basic amenities, promoting compliance with budgetary stipulations, and ensuring the prosecution of corrupt individuals.    In July    2021, BudgIT’s visibility included twenty-six states, 586 local government areas where it has held 7,612 town hall meetings, reached 4,850,000 Nigerians via digital and physical spaces, tracked 15,859 projects, and impacted 9,006 communities.  [26]  Current projectsBudgIT can be described as a “pioneer in the field of social advocacy melded with technology”  [27]  As a Civicus Alliance and Open Alliance member, BudgIT is also leading Nigeria’s global Open Government Partnership membership. BudgIT played a crucial part in convincing the Nigerian government to join the Open Government Partnership, a multilateral initiative to promote transparency and stamp out corruption.  [28]BudgIT seeks to encourage states and local governments to become more transparent with their budgets. It believes that specific legislation, such as the Fiscal Responsibility Act, anchors public finance, must be improved to ensure greater transparency and accountability. BudgIT has begun to engage the National Assembly committees on the sections of the law that inhibit transparency.To tackle apathy among citizens, BudgIT collaborates with local civil society organizations (CSOs) in extensive training on budget comprehension. Augmented with printed graphics in local languages and town-hall meetings, BudgIT has successfully distributed over 150,000 copies of simplified budget documents in 16 states. Tracka directly led to the completion of over 80 community projects.  BudgIT intends to create a database for primary health care centers in Nigeria to coordinate funding (personnel, equipment, and organization) for effective management and operations.  [29]Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe Standard Innovation Review describes BudgIT as “a civic organization driven to make the Nigerian budget and public data more understandable and accessible across every literacy span. BudgIT indeed provided several supports to scale our work in the last one year.”  [30]BudgIT is recognized for its efforts in tracking government expenditure by identifying fiscal irregularities and the mismanagement of funds” in public office. The United States Institute of Peace described BudgIT’s activities as an “investigative or exposé-style research into budgets, spending, and other state policies that shock [people] with what the facts are.”  [31]    However, in 2019, the appointment of Seun Onigbinde, co-founder of BudgIT as Technical Adviser at the Ministry of Budget and National Planning generated missed reactions and negative press for BudgIT with some critics describing his appointment a contradiction to the non-partisan stance of BudgIT.  [32]While BudgIT’s technological approach is commendable, a significant hurdle in BudgIT’s activities is the extent of visibility in Nigeria due to the high level of illiteracy in areas concentrated by the voting population and limited access to digital amenities.However, BudgIT’s activities    led Forbes to recognize it as one of the top five African startups to watch in 2013.  [33]As a community leader on Twitter commented in 2018: “Thank you, Tracka, these are the kinds of things we would not have known without you, and now you have brought all of us together to fight this corruption.”  [34]References[1]  Oluseun Olugbinde, “Destination Democracy via Tech: BudgIT as A Case Study,”  Africa Policy  Review, April 2020,http://digital.africapolicyreview.com/destination-democracy-via-technology-budgit-as-a-case-study/  .[2]“Nigeria’s Inept National Assembly, Most Expensive In The World,”The Nigerian Voice,June 2 2010,https://www.thenigerianvoice.com/news/25769/nigerias-inept-national-assembly-most-expensive-in-the-wor.html  .[3]“What We Do,” BudgIT, accessed July 16, 2021,https://yourbudgit.com/[4]“Who We Are”BudgIT, accessed July 16, 2021,https://cchubnigeria.com/[5]Interview with Abel Akeni, Head, Research and Advocacy, BudgIT, Lagos, Nigeria, on 7th July, 2021.[6]  BudgIT,  States of States 2020Revised Edition, 5.[7]Interview with Abel Akeni, Head, Research and Advocacy, BudgIT, Lagos, Nigeria, on 28th August, 2021.[8]Interview, Abel Akeni.[9]Interview, Abel Akeni.[10]Omidyar Network,  https://omidyar.com/news/omidyar-network-supports-fiscal-transparency-in-nigeria-with-grant-to-budgit/[11]“Our Partners So Far,” BudgIT, accessed July 21, 2021,https://yourbudgit.com/[12]“Community Driven Development,”Participedia,https://participedia.net/method/7413[13]“Community Based Monitoring,”  Participedia,  https://participedia.net/method/5042[14]  “About Us,”  ,” BudgIT, accessed July 24, 2021,https://yourbudgit.com/about-us/[15]Interview, Abel Akeni.[16]Oluseun Olugbinde, “Destination Democracy via Tech: BudgIT as A Case Study,”  Africa Policy  Review, April 2020,http://digital.africapolicyreview.com/destination-democracy-via-technology-budgit-as-a-case-study/[17]  “About Us,”  ,” BudgIT, accessed July 24, 2021,https://yourbudgit.com/about-us/[18]Iyanuoluwa Fatoba, “Tracka Empowers 24 Community-Based Groups In the Oil-producing States on Budget Advocacy, Project Tracking and Service Delivery,” May 14, 2021,  Medium  https://medium.com/@BudgITng/tracka-empthe-owers-24-community-based-groups-in-oil-producing-states-on-budget-advocacy-project-d8ab9830beae  [19]  “Budgeted Spending,” CovidTrackaFund, accessed July 24, 2021,  https://civichive.org/covidtracka/#/spending/budgetedspending[20]Omolabake Fasogbon“BudgIT Reviews COVID-19 Fund Management in New Report,”April 24, 2021,  This Day,  https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2021/04/24/budgit-reviews-covid-19-fund-management-in-new-report/[21]Samuel Itodo and David O’Regan, “Nigeria’s Movement for Transparency and Accountability,” USIP Special Report 433, October 2018,https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/2018-10/sr433-nigerias-movement-for-transparency-and-accountability-bringing-the-pieces-together.pdf  ,ISBN: 978-1-60127-743-5,10.[22]  “ Analysis of the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill,” BudgIT, May 2017,www.yourbudgit.com/wp-content /uploads/2017/05/Petroleum-Industry-Governance-Bill-INFOGRAPHICS.pdf[23]Abiola Afolabi, “Going forward, Looking Beyond: A Reflection on BudgIT’s Expansion II,”  Medium @BudgITNg  November 20, 2020,  https://medium.com/@BudgITng/going-forward-looking-beyond-a-reflection-on-budgits-expansion-ii-c593668df1f4[24]Interview, Abel Akeni.[25]Interview, Abel Akeni.[26]  “Tracka,”  https://tracka.ng/#/home  .[27]  “About Us,”  ,” BudgIT, accessed July 6, 2021,https://yourbudgit.com/about-us/  [28]Jennifer Guay, “Nigeria Holds Public Servants Accountable With Budget Watchdog,”Apolitical,March 6, 2017,https://apolitical.co/solution-articles/en/nigeria-holds-public-servants-accountable-budget-watchdog[29]Interview, Abel Akeni.[30]“About PLSI,”  PLSI Annual Report 2016/17:Agitation, Innovation and Orchestration,  3.[31]Samuel Itodo and David O’Regan, “Nigeria’s Movement for Transparency and Accountability,” 6.[32]Wale Odunsi, “Seun Onigbinde: Reactions as BudgIT Co-founder Joins Buhari’s Government, Deactivates Twitter Account,”Daily Post Nigeria,September 13, 2019,  https://dailypost.ng/2019/09/13/seun-onigbinde-reactions-budgit-co-founder-joins-buhari-govt-deactivates-twitter-account[33]Omidyar Network,  https://omidyar.com/news/omidyar-network-supports-fiscal-transparency-in-nigeria-with-grant-to-budgit/  [34]Tolu Olarewaju, Ibrahim Rufai and Samanthika Gallage, “E-transparency And Government Budgetary Corruption: A Social Marketing And Transformation Case From Nigeria”  Wiley,  December 15, 2020,  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/isd2.12167  , 10.

This can be traced to the extent of corruption prevalent in Nigeria’s public space.  [1]As a result, there is a limited number of youths actively involved in governance. Accountability Lab, Nigeria seeks to combat corruption by promoting acts of integrity visible in Nigeria and offers a beam of hope to disgruntled citizens.Its vision is a country in which resources are used wisely, decisions benefit everyone fairly, and people lead secure lives. This is illustrated in AL Nigeria's three mutually-reinforcing objectives: to support a positive movement in fostering accountability and democracy; ensure the voices of communities are heard on accountability issues; and support collaboration around accountability and open governance through unlikely networks.Origins and DevelopmentAccountability Lab is described as a “global trans-local network” boasts of twelve network labs, four program partners, 104 staff, and a budget of four million dollars.  [2]   Established in Nepal in 2012, it has carved a niche for itself as a trans-local network rather than an international civic organization geared towards tackling corruption challenges through the implementation of creative solutions.  In January 2017, Accountability Lab, Nigeria (AL Nigeria) was inaugurated as one of the network labs of Accountability Lab. Mr. Odeh Friday’s (Country Director, AL Nigeria) desire to instill change and development through implementing change-oriented policies precipitated the establishment of Accountability Lab, Nigeria. In 2017, after an intensive recruitment exercise, Mr. Odeh Friday was bestowed with setting the groundwork for an Accountability Lab branch in Nigeria with the mission “to make governance work for people through supporting active citizens, responsible leaders, and accountable institutions.” [3]  There is a need to instill hope in youth on the prospects of good governance and accountability in Nigeria’s public space. In the formative years, with headquarters in Abuja, the Board and staff capacity of Accountability Lab Nigeria comprised friends and family with a common goal of attaining set objectives rather than involvement based on qualification or experience.  [4]   However, it is pertinent to note that Accountability Lab, Nigeria, has evolved in personnel, policies, and activities.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe richness of the staff and Board of directors has played a vital role in the effective administration of the organization and the level of achievements recorded. The Board of Directors includes Dr. Joe Abah (Country Director), Dr. Yemi Kale (Chairman), Mr. Odeh Friday (Secretary), Miss. Lola Aladesanmi (Board Member), Miss. Enene Ejembi (Board Member), Miss. Gloria Ekpo (Board Member), Miss. Saadatu Falila Hamu (Board Member), and Miss. Beverley Hatcher-Mbu (Board Member).  [5]  The staff is led by Odeh Friday (Country Director), Grace Okpara (Finance and Admin Manager), Prince Chukwuma (Communication Lead), Ehi Idakwo (Programs and Learning Manager), Mnenga Shiiwua (Project Officer), and Kelly Osuji (Project Officer).Currently, there are fifteen full-time staff and twenty-five volunteers. The availability of volunteers nationwide is need-based depending on the project(s) being handled. During project execution, state volunteers are recruited with stipends to ensure task completion. In fostering youth development and advancement, there is the availability of interns who are corps members following National Youth Service Corps obligations (a mandatory one-year training for Nigerian graduates).  [6]     To foster youth inclusivity, there is room for collaboration and volunteering opportunities accessible on its website. This is carried out in various forms: pro-bono services, co-hosting events, writing guest blogs, accountability ambassador, in-kind, and cash donations. [7]  Employment opportunities and internship placements are also advertised on its official website. All staff, volunteers, interns are guided by the core value of integrity, innovation, humility, practicality, and collaboration. AL Nigeria has benefitted from the pedigree of its global office in fostering partnership and grants, particularly its relationship with the MacArthur Foundation. In 2019, Ford Foundation supported with $55,000 to kickstart the achievement of set objectives. Also, there was a partnership with the Government of the Netherlands, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Canadian Embassy, Luminate, National Endowment for Democracy, and VOICE (linked to OXFAM). Accountability Lab engages in training and consultancy for civic-society organizations setting up in Nigeria.  Regarding local funding, Accountability Lab, Nigeria has reached out to possible donors based on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSO). It is still in the negotiation stage with a caveat of a transparent engagement. However, funding remains one of the challenges faced by Accountability Lab despite financial support from Accountability Lab (global office), probably due to its immense activities. [8]   Specializations, Methods and ToolsUsing Community-driven development (CDD) programs aimed at improving “transparency, participation, accountability, and enhance local capacity,”  [9]  AL Nigeria adopts methods and tools based on a three-prong approach: Value-Shifting campaigns; training and collaborative spaces; and eco-building. These approaches entail positive campaigns within and outside government, equipping changemakers with necessary tools, skills, and knowledge, and promotion of collaborative initiatives, respectively. [10]  Accountability Lab adopts creative means of passing positive messages such as music, radio engagement, community outreach, consortium involvement, town hall meetings, trainings, coalition building, social media engagement, and multi-stakeholder dialogues.  Major Projects and EventsAccountability Lab, Nigeria has engaged in a series of projects promoting positive actions and attitudes towards good governance and transparency. These projects include Integrity icons, Accountability Incubator, Voice2Rep (Voice To Represent), Peace and Social Cohesion Innovation Challenge, Civic Action Teams (formerly Citizen Helpdesks), and SDG16.  [11]The uniqueness of Accountability Lab’s approach in Integrity Icons is to encourage people to tell positive stories rather than emphasize the negative information of corruption prevalent in Nigeria’s public sector. Launched in October 2017 with the support of the Ford Foundation, the Integrity Icons project aims to reward and foster conversations on integrity among the citizens and government in Nigeria. This is a global campaign that cuts across various sectors nationwide. According to Accountability Lab, “we want to move away from ‘naming and shaming’ corrupt leaders and towards ‘naming and faming’ those bureaucrats that are working with integrity”  [12]The criteria for nomination include: the individual must be a public servant, at least five years from retirement, and open to interviews.  [13]  The selection process for the Integrity Icons award entails submission of entries through nomination by Nigeria citizens and volunteers, hosting public forums and awareness on the importance of integrity in public service, background checks on the nominees by the ICPC, retired civil servants, and other independent judges from the private sector, CSOs, and the media; leading to the selection of five shortlisted candidates to receive an Integrity Icon award yearly. That is, “people who do things the right way and ensure we have services delivered to citizens in the right way without cutting corners or without corrupt practices,” particularly at local levels.  [14]The volunteers’ nominations are based on tips or field investigations of prospective nominees.  Consequently, the finalists are filmed, the episodes are shown on national television, played on the radio for a week, and posted on official social media accounts to create a national discussion offline and online. Citizens can vote for their favorites through SMS short-codes and the website-  https://integrityicon.org. The winners are crowned in a national ceremony in Abuja. [15]  The Integrity Icons for 2020 include Faith Momoh (a Nurse and Nutrition officer at a Local Government (LGA) secretariat in Ugwolawo Kogi state), Dr. Abiola Jimoh (Divisional Officer for the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps, in Badagry, Lagos), Phillip Ezegbulam (Chief Secretary of the Police Service Commission in Nigeria), Dr. Mohammed Rabiu (a lecturer at Nassarawa State University) and Oyeronke Suebat(Deputy Provost, the College of Health and Technology in Lagos, Nigeria). [16] Founded in 2018, Accountability Incubator  , funded by the MacArthur Foundation, focuses on youth engagement and empowerment to inspire the implementation of accountability initiatives in various communities. Interested applicants who meet the criteria apply via Accountability Lab’s official website. Selected candidates engage in training (quarterly meet-ups and online modules), hands-on mentorship (support for the development of ideas), communications support (such as promo videos and blogs), networks (through pitch events and “friendraisers”), and other resources (an innovation fund). [17]  In 2020, “Accountapreneurs” (Accountability Incubator participants) were selected with a focus on empowering youths with interests in the extractive, education, and health sectors. Similarly, the SDG16 initiative, with support from the Canadian government, organizes youth-oriented national competitions focusing on developing approaches and formulating innovative ideas proffering solutions to SDG16 related problems. This is in accordance with the United Nations Development Programme to achieve Goal 16 of the Sustainable Development Goals on peace, justice, and strong institutions. One representative is selected from twenty states, and a winner is determined based on the peace-innovation idea presented for future implementation. The finalists present their initiatives at a three-day workshop organized by AL Nigeria, where three winners are selected. The winners are awarded laptops, networking opportunities, and spots in Accountability Incubator for one year to refine and develop their ideas. ( Accountability Lab, “SDG16 Innovation Challenge,” https://accountabilitylab.org/our-work/sdg-16-innovation-challenge/ ). Some of the peace innovation ideas implemented include the Abuja Photo Festival and Hope Behind Bars in 2017. [18]The tools deployed by AL Nigeria have resulted in positive changes in various sectors across the country. Notably, the Voice2Rep initiative sponsored by Luminate and the Government of the Netherlands engages young people through music. It connects to audiences using accountability-themed songs to foster the use of music to promote transparency. According to Friday Odeh, “it is an axiom that music is a universal language, and there is no better time than now to encourage young talent to lend their voices to social activism through their art now that the Nigerian music industry has transcended beyond our borders.”  [19]For instance, in the 2018/2019 edition, an album was released featuring all the artists involved in the competition titled  In These Present Times and available on all major streaming platforms, including iTunes and Amazon. The finalists go through professional training and mentoring programs, culminating in a national concert where a winner is voted. Although no prize money is involved, the winning songs are professionally produced and circulated nationally and internationally. [20] On August 26, 2021, a 13-album listening party was held, which “highlights the violation of human rights while uplifting the resilient spirit of citizens and promoting citizen’s collective responsibility in nation-building.” [21] To promote inclusivity in Nigeria, AL Nigeria initiated a project aimed at the government’s allocation of at least ten percent of Nigeria’s employment slots and provision of accessible building facilities for persons with disabilities. This entailed advocating for a Disability Act as Nigeria is one of the countries yet to implement policies that include accessible-inclined buildings and agenda. According to activist Grace Joy, “if we say that we are promoting accountability, we should not forget those who are living with disabilities.”  [22]    In 2020, the COVID’19 lockdown and restrictions was a source of worry for AL Nigeria based on the inability and difficulty in meeting basic needs faced by persons living with disabilities in Nigeria. [23]  As a member of Civil Society Coalition on Audit in Nigeria (CSCAN), AL Nigeria seeks to promote initiatives that tackle corrupt practices in Nigeria and improvement in increasing the political participation of person living with disabilities. This entails the inclusion of all citizens (tribe, religion, ability, and gender). In 2019, Nigeria signed the Disability Act to improve accessibility by those facing disability. In 2019, the Civic Action Teams was launched as a pioneering citizen feedback, dialogue, and community voice platform to ensure accountability in the development process. They collect critical information from communities and individuals, solving daily problems for citizens and closing the loop on challenges affecting the populace.  [24]Current ProjectsAsides from the annual implementation of projects discussed, Accountabilitea Show, a radio program aired on local radio stations, is a recent addition to AL Nigeria’s initiatives. The radio stations include Darling 107.3 FM at 1-2 pm on Fridays (Imo State), Comfort 95.1 FM at 1-2 pm on Fridays (Akwa-Ibom State), and KU 92.7 FM at 10 am on Thursdays (Edo State). Also,   some Integrity Icons and AL Nigeria’s activities are featured on Accountabilitea podcast (Accountability Lab global office’s podcast) to reach a global audience. AL Nigeria strives to “make governance work by supporting active citizens, responsible leaders, and accountable institutions while building capacity and enhancing knowledge within young changemakers.” [25]Analysis and Lessons LearnedIt is essential to note that all country stations share one website (a global website). This makes it quite challenging to isolate the activities and identify the achievements of Accountability Lab, Nigeria. Perhaps, the country stations should have individual website account while maintaining their global collaboration and presence on the global website. Also, the number of activities engaged in shows that more volunteers are needed to improve efficacy and reach. However, AL Nigeria continues in its goal of “ending impunity within government by building accountability and improving decision-making processes through citizen engagement and inclusion.”  [26]  According to Wilson Atumeyi, one of the beneficiaries of AL Nigeria’s initiatives, “the incubator program has availed me with several opportunities that have moved me from stage A to stage B…I know after the program there will be more room for opportunities.”  [27]  References     [1]Vincent Ufuoma,    “ICPC Pledges To Sustain New Ethics, Integrity In Fight Against Corruption,”    March 18, 2021,  ICIR,https://www.icirnigeria.org/icpc-pledges-to-sustain-new-ethics-integrity-in-fight-against-corruption/.

These programs can be integrated into existing postsecondary curriculums and enrolled in by individuals seeking professional and personal development.  Soliya’s offerings provide the space for small groups of individuals from different countries to share their perspectives and gain a better understanding of other cultures and views with the goal of eliminating “the idea of ‘the other’ so that we can thrive in this 21st Century society.” [1] The programs also aim to teach conflict resolution strategies and refine participants’ critical thinking skills. Soliya, therefore, provides opportunity for the development of personal and professional skills.Vision: “A pluralistic world where diversity is embraced and conflicts are transformed into opportunities for collaboration and collective learning.”Mission:  “To prepare rising generations to approach differences constructively and lead with empathy, in order to thrive in an interconnected world.”[1]  Origins and Development  Soliya, Inc. was incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation with its headquarters in New York City, U.S., in July 2002 and publicly launched in 2003.[2] Lucas Welch and Liza Chambers co-founded the organization as they grew increasingly concerned about a lack of constructive dialogue between people of Western and Muslim majority countries after 9/11. Welch and Chambers sought to use developing digital and communications spaces to foster meaningful, critical, and empathetic dialogue.  The organization developed a custom videoconferencing platform to foster such dialogue, called the  Exchange Portal . This website was designed to allow individuals to connect online in ways that mimicked face-to-face small group settings.  In October 2009, Soliya partnered with the  United Nations Alliance of Civilizations .[3] In 2011, Soliya formed the Exchange 2.0 Coalition with  Global Nomads Group  and the  International Education and Resource Network (iEARN-USA) . This partnership, later known as the  Virtual Exchange Coalition , allowed Soliya to better provide cross-cultural experiences within their programs.[4]  In 2014, Soliya merged with  Search for Common Ground , an organization focused on using dialogue, media, and community building to foster sustainable peacebuilding. Through this merger, Soliya’s virtual exchange programs continue to be implemented under the name Soliya and using the same Soliya staff team, however, they operate under the direction and with the support of Search for Common Ground.[5]  Currently, Soliya seeks to foster dialogue around the world but remains focused on cultivating constructive and cooperative dialogue between youth in Western and Muslim communities.[6]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Soliya is run by a Board of Directors, a team of over thirty staff members, and a vast network of volunteer facilitators, trainers, and fellows.  As of 2021, the Board of Directors consists of six members (click  here  for Board member bios) appointed by Search for Common Ground.[7] CEO Waidehi Gokhale leads the team of staff members which includes directors, coordinators, and officers for each program offered by the organization, as well as multiple roles in information technology, partnerships and outreach, operations and administration, and specialist roles in media and design (click  here  for brief bios on each staff member). As part of the organization’s work, Soliya also trains facilitators and fellows to assist in leading their programs as facilitators and moderators.[8]  In addition to Soliya’s strategic alliance with Search for Common Ground discussed above, Soliya is also partnered with Stevens Initiative, Global Affairs Canada, Erasmus+ Virtual Exchange, UN-Habitat, Open Road Alliance, Annenburg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylaniva, Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences Social Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, and UCL Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science.[9] To implement their cross-cultural dialogue approach, Soliya is also partnered with more than 280 postsecondary institutions around the world (click  here  for a complete list of partnered postsecondary institutions).  Soliya has an enrollment rate of approximately 15,000 individuals per year in their programs. Postsecondary institutions offering existing related program curriculums are able to request that their school be a part of the Connect and First Year Connect programs. Individuals can apply to the free Social Circles program.[10]  This organization is registered as a public charity and, therefore, receivesmost of their funding from government grants and public support. In 2019, Soliya received $690,010 in government grants and $550,627 in the form of other institutional grants and gifts or donations.[11]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  Soliya’s work is based on developing and fostering Virtual Exchange (VE) opportunities. Virtual Exchange, also known as telecollaboration, uses technology to support face-to-face education programs focused on sustaining constructive dialogue across national borders and cultures. VE experiences are structured and facilitated to ensure critical reflection, understanding, and empathy is fostered within the discussions.[12]  Soliya was considered a pioneer of early VE development and, along with their partners in the Virtual Exchange Coalition, they were one of the first initiatives to use the term Virtual Exchange. Soliya’s involvement in VE is considered to be a service-provider approach.[13] Using developing web conferencing technology, Soliya created their own platform called the Exchange Portal to conduct VE programs and create the opportunity for postsecondary institutions to outsource their VE needs. This videoconferencing platform continues to be refined as web conferencing technology has developed. The Exchange Portal was designed using VE and conflict resolution best practices. The platform situates participant videos in a circle on the screen to resemble a round table discussion. It only allows a maximum of 24 participants per meeting to ensure participants can see all screens to interpret body language. During each meeting, the platform only allows one person to unmute their microphone at a time to eliminate the possibility of interrupting another participant.[14]  Major Projects and Events  Soliya’s work is centred around their four main virtual exchange-related programs offered throughout the year. They also provide opportunities for custom program development and project support, as requested.Connect is a 4 to 8-week program that can be integrated into existing postsecondary course curriculums to support instructors in providing opportunities for students to engage in facilitated, cross-cultural dialogue outside of the classroom. Led by 1 to 2 facilitators trained within Soliya’s programs, participants in the program engage in weekly online discussions with up to 10 other students from various universities around the world. No more than 2 students from each class are in a discussion group together to promote more global connections and ensure a greater diversity of perspectives in each meeting. Participants are encouraged to share their perspectives and opinions during these sessions with facilitators present to ensure the discussions remain respectful and to encourage critical thinking. This program has been implemented in university-level courses such as those in media studies, international relations, religious studies, business, and engineering.There are three offerings within the Connect Program. Connect Global is an 8-week program uses discussions of current events to foster communication skills and empathetic reception to differing perspectives. Connect Collaborate is a 5-week program is focused on teambuilding in an online environment using a current event topic to which students must apply practical lessons. Connect Express is a 4-week program that centres its discussions around the role of identity in global societal divisions.[15]  First Year Connect is a 4-week program with a similar approach and offering to the Connect program, however, with a focus on local community building within postsecondary campuses in the United States. Soliya saw a need for bridging the growing divisions in the U.S. and saw their program model that has been used on a global scale as potentially being useful in creating spaces for American students to discuss differences in a facilitated environment with the emphasis on respectful and constructive dialogue. The goal of the First Year Connect program is to instill these practices of respectful dialogue in first-year university students so that they can continue to implement such practices throughout their campus experiences, thereby fostering a more understanding and engaged student body. This program involves 2-hour weekly synchronous sessions on the Exchange Portal during which students discuss current events and topics of relevance to their campus environment in a group of no more than 10 participants led by a trained facilitator.[16]  The Global Circles program offers individuals 18 years of age or older an opportunity to engage in constructive dialogue on controversial subjects that are of global importance and impact. The program requires participants to attend to 2 online meetings on the Exchange Portal during which they engage in discussion activities led by facilitators and complete individual assignments throughout the two-week session, culminating in a certificate of completion. Topics addressed in the 2021 sessions include vaccination safety, access, and ethics; freedom of speech and its limits; and do we trust science?[17]  The Facilitation Training program engages professionals and new participants to practice conflict resolution skills that are valuable in facilitating Soliya’s virtual exchange programs as well as for problem-solving and mediating needs more broadly. Soliya offers synchronous and asynchronous facilitation training options, as well as Arabic-language training modules. During the trainings, participants engage in virtual discussions, complete readings and assignments, and practice facilitation with certified facilitation coaches. After completion of the full training program, participants receive a UN-Habitat certificate for the Advanced Facilitation Training and PracticumAnalysis and Lessons Learned  Soliya sought to evaluate their global and educational impact through multi-year evaluations in collaboration with the Saxelab Social Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the Annenberg School of Communication, University of Pennsylvania; Oxford Centre for the Study of Intergroup Conflict, University of Oxford; and University College London.

[1] It is a network of leaders from all population groups and sectors of Israeli society, in collaboration with Atudot Le'Israel, that builds trust among decision-makers and creates changes and multi-sector solutions for citizens and systems in four core areas: local governance, health, education, and employment [2]. MAOZ operates under four core basic assumptions: [3]The promotion of socio-economic resilience is a complex challenge which requires multi-sectoral and systemic collaboration, as well as determined leadership that promotes real-world solutions.  Socio-economic resilience and trust are inter-related  Trust is the infrastructure for promoting cross-system collaboration and solutions, and its absence creates siloed work that hinders the potential for change.  It is possible to increase trust by increasing one's awareness of the other through their stories, driving diversity, improving professionalism and ethics, and by promoting a concept of shared responsibility. These are the principles of mamlachtiut promoted by MAOZ.  Actions that increase trust between leaders and decision-makers will echoto additional circles in the Israeli society and serve as a basis for cooperation and solutions in reality.In addition, MAOZ has four major organizational goals it hopes to reach by 2024: [4]To develop a trust-based network of 800 members with a shared language and high levels of trust who advance socio-economic resilience through ongoing learning, trust-promoting practices &amp; collaborations. MAOZ seeks to have 70% of network members be “influential, diverse and have high social capital”.  To strengthen the capacities of 200 Network members’ organizations and increase effectiveness via trust-promoting structures, work methods and practices.  To promote changes in reality through 200 Network members’ organizations.  To spread trust through 10,000 socio-economic field officials who are exposed to and who regularly utilize trust-related knowledge and ideas.Origins and Development  MAOZ was co-founded in 2010 by current board members Jeffrey Swartz and Doron Latzer and by Dr. yair Schindel and Yotam Dagan on the principle that the socio-economic resilience of Israel depends largely upon the quality of its leaders.[5] In 2010, MAOZ’s founders envisioned a network of values-driven leaders working together on tangible initiatives to transform the Israeli public sphere. Today, MAOZ develops and networks change-makers to confront the fragmented nature of Israeli society; the lack of social cohesion across sectors and populations; the absence of long-term planning; and insufficient talent pipelines to produce high-quality and principled leaders. With close to 200 in the MAOZ Network as of 2021, the impact of MAOZ is increasingly visible in areas such as health, education, employment and more.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingOrganizational StructureMAOZ is an Israel-based organization with a global network extending primarily into the United States and Europe. The organization comprises of a leadership group, a board of directors, and the general membership who take part in MAOZ’s pedagogical and networking initiatives. [6]MembershipMAOZ seeks to recruit “diverse, high-caliber candidates who have the potential to lead socio-economic change in Israel”.[7] Members are admitted based on the merit of their Hebrew-language application form into one of four training programs: [8]The MAOZ Fellows Program: prepares and networks mid-level and senior officials and focuses on the issue of employment.  The Amber Program: a joint venture with the ministry of health which focuses on the training of a managerial reserve in all areas of the health system.  The Ripple Program: a joint venture with the ministry of education which focuses on the training of leadership reserves for the senior level in the education system.  The Place Plan: a joint venture with the ministry of the interior which focuses on the training of leadership reserves for the senior echelon in the local space.FundingMAOZ’s annual budget has grown extensively since their 2015 from $3.1 million USD to $13.8 million USD in 2019. [9] Approximately 80% of MAOZ’s funding is from American, Israeli, and foreign philanthropy, while another 20% comes from the Israeli government.[10] MAOZ further specifies the origins of their income sources, with 40% derived from Israel and 60% coming from overseas donors. MAOZ receives 30% of its funding from individuals, 45% from foundations, 23% from the Israeli government, and 2% from participation fees for events and training programs. [11] Furthermore, MAOZ stipulates that no single investor, individual, or foundation is permitted to invest more than 20% of the annual budget in order to maintain transparency, accountability, and diversity. [12]. MAOZ provides a highly specific breakdown of expenditures on their  website .  Specializations, Methods and Tools  MAOZ has a strong focus on education and trust-based networking to give members skills and opportunities which will maximize their impact in the public sphere. For example, the MAOZ Fellows program comprises of seven weeks of intensive learning spread throughout the year, including one week at Harvard Business School in the USA. It uses an “on the job” training format such that fellows can continue working while participating in the program, allowing them to immediately apply their new knowledge and skills to real-world situations. MAOZ Fellows also uses peer learning and shared consultation regarding challenges faced by the fellows in their professional positions. [13]  The MAKOM municipal leadership pipeline program also comprises of 7 dispersed weeks of study including one at Harvard Business School and the “on the job” training format. [14] It also teaches on the public sphere at the community, municipal, national and international level, emphasising economic development and a “residents at the centre” approach. Furthermore, it provides the opportunity to network with government officials, business leaders and other experts in the public and private sectors. MAKOM also has a “dedicated accelerator program” that provides professional tools, resources, and expert consultation to accelerate change-process projects.[15]  The INBAR Healthcare management program develops personal leadership capabilities, addresses Israel’s socio-economic challenges and their impact on the nation’s healthcare system, and builds on MAOZ’s group network. It also allows participants to receive an MBA with a specialization in Health Systems Management at Tel Aviv University Business school, a 6 semester program specifically built for INBAR fellows. Lastly, it provides members with professional management training for managerial roles in healthcare. [16]  The AVDOT leadership pipeline for the Israeli education system, in addition to offering the same 7 week program and “training on the job” format at MAOZ Fellows and MAKOM, facilitates peer networking and learning to advance MAOZ members within the education sector. [17]  Major Projects and Events  MAOZ has four major programs and joint ventures: Maoz Fellows, INBAR healthcare management program, MAKOM municipal leadership pipeline program, and ADVOT leadership pipeline for the Israeli education system. [18] In cooperation with the Atudot Le’Israel Division in the Prime Minister’s Office, MAOZ is working to implement the Atudot Le’Israel government resolution – a strategic plan for building a leadership pipeline for the public sphere in Israel. In this framework MAOZ operates Joint Ventures, with relevant government ministries, in MAOZ strategic focus areas: Inbar (with the Ministry of Health), ADVOT (with the Ministry of Education) MAKOM (with the Ministry of Interior) and the MAOZ Employment Venture (a partnership with the Labor and Social Welfare Department).[19]  The initiatives are designed to promote systemic change by creating a common language around the core challenges of the various systems, increasing the trust among the top players across areas of influence, developing leaders’ professionally, and creating a network of leaders that drive significant change processes collaboratively. The members of the programs represent diverse populations and employment sector in Israel including private, NGO, public, municipal and communications.  Throughout the year, there are interactions among the members of the various programs aimed at advancing mamlachti (common good) actions for the benefit of Israel’s economic and social resilience.  Upon completion of the programs, the members join MAOZ and Atudot Le’Israel’s Network, which is a multi-disciplinary and diverse multi-sectoral network, which is a space for leading and accelerating economic and social change initiatives and changes in the country. [20]  The MAOZ Fellows program is an employment joint venture that trains and connects valued, professional and mamlachti (common-good behaviors and actions) senior leaders. The program focuses on identifying fellows from the field of employment that come from the social, governmental, municipal, private and media sectors and represent the diverse population groups acroass the Israeli society  The training is based on meaningful learning and constant synergy among theory, reality, and experience in an effort to create lasting change in the field of employment. By working on leaders’ self-identity and values, and by receiving professional tools, the leaders are able to address the burning internal social and economic challenges of Israel and strengthen its socio-economic resilience. [21]  The MAKOM municipal leadership pipeline program is a joint venture of the Ministry of the Interior and MAOZ, and a part of the government resolution, “Atudot Le’Israel” – striving to build a tri-sector management pipeline for Israel’s local government sphere. The joint venture identifies, trains, and networks leaders and accelerates initiatives of senior positions in the local government system, civil society, private sector, and central government with the goal of fostering a generation of mamlachti (common good) leaders capable of and effective at leading change in the local sphere.[22]  The INBAR Healthcare management program is a joint venture with the Ministry of Health, which strives to develop and nurture excelling and values-based doctors in order to create a leadership pipeline focused on the better good in the healthcare system. The program is supported by the Ministry of Finance, the Civil Service Commission, Israeli HMOs and the Prime Minister’s Office. [23]  Lastly, AVDOT leadership pipeline for the Israeli education system is a joint venture between the Ministry of Education and MAOZ, whose goal is to create a management pipeline for tri-sector professionals across Israel’s education system. The program endeavors to create a shared language around the education system’s core challenges, to increase trust between senior and diverse players in the system’s various focus points of influence, develop existing leaders within the educational system and create a network of change-making leaders that collaborate to create meaningful change. [24]  Analysis and Lessons Learned  As MAOZ trains professionals, experts, and those engaged in civic society, their impact has the potential to be quite diverse and experienced across a number of sectors. The organization has continued to see consistent growth in membership and donations, indicating its networking and promotional ventures have been successful. In 2018 the network grew to 323 members and was expected to reach 474 by the end of 2019. [25] Furthermore, during 2018 MAOZ supported 40 “social change processes” and 17 more projects were provided with “additional leverage”. [26]  In 2017-2018, with the aim to create widespread impact, MAOZ, in partnership with the Israeli government scaled its model to benefit strategic areas within the public sphere (i.e. education, health, municipal government, and employment). In 2018, MAOZ Fellows - a program for tri-sector leaders had 42 fellows in its 8 th  cohort, MAKOM- a joint venture with Israel's Ministry of the Interior for middle and senior officials in local government had 62 fellows in its 2 nd  Cohort, ADVOT- a joint venture with Israel's Ministry of Education for executives across Israel’s education system had 32 fellows in its 2 nd  Cohort, INBAR - a joint venture with Israel's Ministry of Health to develop the next leaders of the healthcare industry had 31 fellows in its 3 rd  &amp; 4 th  cohort. [27]  Furthermore, MAOZ drives leading research to guide strategic growth and help their Network Members and organization integrate data-based decision making. The Center also creates case studies and research for Network Members and Accelerator fellows on different issues in MAOZ's four core activity areas. In 2018, MAOZ's Knowledge Center carried out research and produced a total of 43 papers on a range of subjects from advancing Arab employees to managerial positions in the private sector to best practices for digital literacy interventions for young Arab and ultra-Orthodox populations.

[1] It works to ensure that victims receive support – social, economic, physical/mental, and political – and create a space for the voices of members in a deliberative process so that their demands drive the organization’s campaigns, positions, and activities. The KSG works with other civic and community organizations to develop capacity for advocacy support in regional, national and international contexts.  Origins and Development  The apartheid system in South Africa, based on the Afrikaaner principle of separateness, systematically classified people into distinct racial categories with corresponding rights and privileges. From 1948 to 1994, the apartheid system violently restricted Africans to overcrowded reserves and specific spheres of economic activity. All Africans not involved in the mining economy were displaced to reserves outside of white urban centers. Under apartheid, many people suffered mental and physical trauma, poverty exacerbated by the loss of family members or destroyed homes,and the inability to access education, social services, or basic support. With the success of the African National Congress under Nelson Mandela and his calls for non-violence and reconciliation, the National Unity and Reconciliation Act was passed in 1995 and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) commenced. With Archbishop Desmond Tutu acting as Chairman, the hearings started in 1996.  The KSG was founded in 1995 by a group of survivors of apartheid human rights violations to provide support and assistance to people testifying before the TRC. The KSG has since expanded to cover a broad range of advocacy, campaigns, coalition-building, and interdisciplinary mixed-method approaches to assist those affected by apartheid and to hold the South African government accountable to its TRC reparation commitments.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The KSG's membership is over one hundred thousand and is composed of survivors and family members of victims of gross human rights violations under apartheid. Khulumani’s membership continues to climb because of the impact and scope of the apartheid system and its legacy.  Khulumani is governed by a Board of Trustees comprising persons elected by Khulumani’s National Steering Committee at the Annual General Meeting. The Khulumani Board is in the process of establishing an Advisory Support Group with specific expertise related to Khulumani’s core issues. The National Steering Committee oversees the development and support of Khulumani’s community-based membership. [2]  Khulumani’s National Contact Centre, now based in Pretoria, serves as the coordinating center of the organization and the point of access to the organization for the general public. Its management is the responsibility of the National Director assisted by the Finance and Human Resources Officer and the Member Liaison Officer.  The National Steering Committee comprises three representatives from each of the Provincial Steering Committees and meets as far as possible every six months to inform the work of the organization through cooperative planning and to advise the Board. The office-bearers of the National Steering Committee assist with Board with all planning and decision-making of Khulumani member groups.  The Provincial Steering Committees comprise representatives from different districts within each province and provide leadership on strategic issues affecting their regions of the country.  For a list of members and further information about the governance and management structure, consult:  https://khulumani.net/about-us/#governance-structureSpecializations, Methods, and Tools  The Khulumani Support Group specializes in using advocacy networks, creative interdisciplinary mediums, and a variety of support and campaign tools to support Khulumani members. The organizational work and mixed-methods approach of the KSG are centered on 5 principles: [3]To secure acknowledgment of what happened to victims through ongoing truth-recovery processes. Khulumani uses narrative, ‘art and memory.’ and oral history to document these histories and to produce publications, installations, and exhibitions.To support the collective struggle for social justice to fully realize the achievement of the TRC’s recommendations for rehabilitation and community reparations, and to promote an environment that supports the rule of law, that provides equal access to justice for all citizens and that promotes a culture of accountability. Khulumani pioneered outreach to its members to build capacity in access to and the use of information through the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) to try to hold government at local and national levels accountable.

Promote civic conversations as a habit that values ​​our differences and allows us to connect to each other around them.  Systematize, represent and respond rigorously to the vision of the future of Chilean society.Origins and Development  Chile faced one of its major social and political crises during October 2019, in response to a rise in the Santiago Metro's subway fare. A series of massive demonstrations and severe riots originated in Santiago and spread to all regions of Chile, opening a national debate about the role of violence, corruption and inequality. Although the riots escalated, it also did citizen meetings and spontaneous civic dialoges all over the country. We realized there was an opportunity from that crisis. People were anxious to express their opinions and hear different ones.In this context, the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chiledecided to collaborate and open the resources, facilities and knowledge to promote a massive conversation beyond its campus.Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  This initiative is jointly led by the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (PUC) and the University of Chile (UCh), which are the largest, oldest and most prestigious institutions of higher education in the country.  Specializations, Methods and ToolsSince 2020, we offered online opportunities for citizen participation and civic conversation crystalized under two participation schemes: online surveys and digital conversations through video calls.Online surveys: Participants could log their responses, ideas, proposals and opinions in 17-themed surveys from education, health, gender and inclusion, to the economy, the State and others. The surveys contained not only qualitative questions to be answered through open-ended written responses, but they also featured cases: the surveys ended with three to four cases, all of them inspired by real-life events. Participants had to read them and answer with open-ended, free-writing sentences after going through an empathy exercise. More than 95,000 surveys were recorded during 2020, containing beyond 600,000 responses.Digital conversations through video calls: Participants could choose to set a time and date for a real-time, two-hour-long conversation with 5 other people across the country through Zoom. This conversation was guided by a moderator and followed a dialogue methodology created by the Public Innovation Laboratory at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. Participants themselves would share how they’ve felt in the past months, agree to talk on several issues and end up concluding several ideas, together, in order to bridge differences and converge. More than 12.000 participants were part of this mechanism from across all 346 communes in Chile, including prison inmates, and individuals living in isolated and rural communities throughout the country.Analysis and Lessons Learned  The Latin American region share similar social, political and economical challenges that need to be faced collectively. That is why in 2021 Tenemos que Hablar de Chile shared the experience, methodologies and lessons with universities in Colombia. Six universities from different regions of the country have been working together on the Colombian version of Tenemos que Hablar.",3,1,2,4,0,,"Tenemos que Hablar de Chile is a citizen participation platform led by the largest universities of the country, that aspires to promote civic conversations as a habit that values   our differences and help us to collectively build a vision for the future of Chile."

The purpose of the not-for-profit organization is to spark new ways of imagining and working together to fuel and create social change. Co-founders Annie O’Donoghue and Julia Grady stated, “Our goal is for the Guelph and surrounding community to know 10C as a place where information can be found and shared, where people can gather, and someplace great workshops and interesting forums are hosted.”  Origins and Development  10C Shared Space was launched in 2008 by Annie O’Donoghue and Julia Grady in Guelph, Ontario. The first 10C location was opened at 10 Carden Street in Guelph after Annie and Julia identified a need for a coworking and collaboration space in the community. They noticed a common problem among grassroot organizations and entrepreneurs: many were working on similar projects or setting similar goals without realizing. By creating a shared workspace, such organizations would be able to work together and collaborate in organic and exciting ways.  Since 2008, 10C has expanded from its initial space to a new, larger location at 42 Carden Street. It has become a part of numerous social finance and sustainable development projects and partnerships, and a hub for a diverse range of gatherings. Currently, there are about 200 members of 10C, with an average (pre-COVID-19) annual attendance at community events and workshops.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The organizational structure of 10C Shared Space consists of a community of members, an elected Board of Directors, staff team, volunteers and organizational partners and collaborators.  10C has a variety of membership types available for community members:StudentIndividualOrganizationNourishVentureNourish + OrganizationFunding  10C’s operating budget is derived from multiple sources, such as annual membership fees, coworking and space booking fees, federal, provincial, municipal and community grants, as well as donations and community bonds.  The City of Guelph and University of Guelph are two of the most consistent and longest-standing partners of 10C, alongside many other organizations and individuals in the Guelph-Wellington area.  Specializations, Methods and Tools10C Shared Space focuses on placemaking, community engagement, social enterprise, social finance, sustainable food systems, and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (including goals #17 - Partnerships for the Goals, #9 - Industry Innovation and Infrastructure, and #10 - Reduced Inequalities). The organization strives for these priorities through a variety of projects and initiatives:Nurturing the membershipActivating spaces for allModeling sustainable practicesRunning, supporting or catalyzing projectsCoaching and mentoringActing as a learning hubNetworking, connecting, convening and engagingImagining and leveraging investment in a visionary wayHelping people see and find solutionsActing as a home for community-based researchMajor Projects and Events  In addition to community events like workshops and forums, 10C Shared Space has initiated two major social finance projects. The first is the organization’s Community Bonds Project. Through community bonds - a debt financing tool - 10C takes out loans from community members and invests in the infrastructure of the shared space.  10C’s second notable social finance project is their Harvest Impact Fund. This project builds upon the 10C social finance journey, to provide friendly lending in the form of loans and mentorship to businesses and nonprofits looking to make positive social change. Harvest Impact seeks to use social financing as a tool to create meaningful opportunities in the community that increase social, political, and economic agency for all. Harvest Impact strives to better understand the unique experiences of those whom they work with and the systemic barriers they face when attempting to access funding and business supports.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Establishing a space like 10C in Guelph posed many challenges. The founders and staff members had no prior models to follow or similar organizations to consult. As such, Co-founder and Executive Director Julia Grady explains, “[we] want[ed] 10C to not only be a blueprint for other individuals and organizations, but also for us to be mentors to future change makers. Our hope is to become a sort of community concierge for change makers.”  Despite challenges faced, 10C has grown tremendously with the support of the Guelph community.

Women and girls faced extreme poverty and oppression, living as property in a male-dominated society and rarely seen or heard by the outside world. In response, Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan (CW4WAfghan) was established in 1996 by Canadians dedicated to enhancing the well-being of Afghan women and girls. CW4WAfghan is a nonprofit organization with thirteen volunteer chapters throughout Canada, and it is a federally registered charity that is non-religious and non-political. Canadians and Afghan women have been working together to improve human rights, end women's oppression, and provide opportunities for Afghan women to live with dignity and purpose. Both parties believe that education is the key to true peace in Afghanistan. The CW4WA is dedicated to advancing education and opportunities for Afghan women and their families while also educating Canadians about human rights in Afghanistan. They aim to create sustainable education programs and engage Canadians as global citizens. [i] [4][i]  CW4WAfgahnistan, Annual Report. (2013). Pp;4:  https://cw4wafghan.ca/governance/Origins and DevelopmentBack in 1996, writer Deborah Ellis  was actively striving to draw attention to the dire situation of Afghan women following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan. Ellis established a casual organization known as Women for Women in Afghanistan. Later that year, Janice Eisenhauer and Carolyn crossed paths while pursuing their degrees in International Development at the University of Calgary, Reicher from Calgary. After learning about Afghan women's human rights violations under the Taliban regime, a group of Canadian women felt compelled to help tangibly and effectively. They met with Deb Ellis in Toronto in 1998 and began organizing. Janice and Carolyn led the effort, eventually growing into a national organization called Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan (CW4WA).  Meanwhile, Deb travelled to refugee camps in Pakistan and Russia to meet Afghan women and girls and wrote stories about her experiences. She returned with inspiring stories and a crucial guiding principle: ""Listen to the voices of Afghan women. “Sally Armstrong's journalism, including her groundbreaking 1997 article in Homemakers magazine, brought attention to the human rights crisis faced by Afghan women and girls. During her travels, she visited Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. In 1998, co-founder Janice Eisenhauer signed CW4WAfghan's first by-laws. Armstrong also wrote two books,  Veiled Threat  and  Bitter Roots and Tender Shoots , which shed light on Afghan women's difficulties while fighting for their rights.  CW4WAfghan is a thriving organization comprising various members, including individual volunteers, local chapters, donors, supporters, and two staff teams in Canada and Kabul. Together, they work toward the common goal of promoting human rights for Afghan women by providing them with greater access to education and life-changing opportunities.  Deborah Ellis is a renowned author who has written several award-winning young-adult novels, including  The Breadwinner Trilogy  and  ""My Name is Parvana ."" The stories revolve around the lives of eleven-year-old Parvana and her friend Shauzia, who live in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, and depict the strength, courage, and hope of children who struggle to survive war, poverty, and oppression. Deborah has generously donated all royalties from her books to CW4WAfghan, resulting in over $2 million in grants for education initiatives for Afghan women and girls. Thanks to the contributions of numerous individual donors, hundreds of projects have been initiated to benefit women in Afghanistan, amounting to millions of dollars. Many years ago, Canadians asked, ""What can We do?"" and took action to fight for the fundamental rights of Afghan women and girls. By listening to them, Canadians were able to respond with solidarity and ensure that these rights were not only written on paper but  also practiced in real life. Remember, ""Human rights are universal,"" and ""we can work together to uphold them'.Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The CW4WAfghan is a registered charity in Canada (Canada Revenue Agency #887718203RR0001) and a nonprofit corporation registered with Industry Canada under #415380-4. It is authorized to operate under the Alberta Government Charities Act (#309874).  In 1998, CW4WAfghan became a nonprofit corporation in May 2003 and a registered charity in February 2009. The organization is governed by a Board of Directors of at least three elected Officer positions and up to six additional Directors, per the organization's CRA-approved by-laws. The officers include the National President, National Vice President, National Secretary, and National Treasurer. Directors and officers are nominated and elected by voting members at annual general meetings. [i] [1]  The CW4WA is funded by the Canadian government as well as donations.[i]  Candian Women for Women in Afghanistan. Official Website:  https://cw4wafghan.ca/governance/Specializations, Methods and Tools  CW4WAfghan has a detailed set of policies and procedures that govern various aspects of the organization's operations, including program implementation, financial accountability, and human resource management. The Afghan Republic government legally recognized the organization, and it is a registered charity in good standing with Canada Revenue Agency. It undergoes an annual audit of its Canadian records to ensure compliance with regulations governing charities. These policies and procedures provide that the organization operates transparently and with integrity. Additionally, it has an extensive project review and approval process that evaluates proposals, competitive RFPs, budgets, and required narrative and financial reporting. It conducts site visits to verify that operations align with field reports. Their performance measurement system regularly collects pertinent data from funded services. It enforces policies and guidelines for projects its partners implement and a procurement policy for goods and services. The organization uses legally binding contracts. Their travel directive policy is implemented, and they have a zero-tolerance anti-corruption policy. The CW4WA policies offer guidelines for implementing projects, contracts, and reporting templates. It also establishes clear expectations for financial accountability to ensure efficient project management when working with other organizations. All expenses are reviewed and verified through proper documentation.  Major Projects and Events  Investments in Basic Education: At CW4WAfghan, it believes that having the right to education goes beyond simply having access to school. It also means having access to quality education. While Afghanistan has made significant progress in increasing the number of schools, teachers, and students from 2002 to 2021, there were still significant challenges regarding the quality of education. That is why it has been Investing in Basic Education Program focuses on improving the quality of education by training teachers and providing them with more resources through various projects such as The Lantern Fund 2025, The Gender Equity in Teacher Training to Improve Girls' Education (GETT) Project, Getting Girls Back to School, School and Library Starter Kits, School Support, and Accessible Storybooks for Children. Through the Learning Baskets initiative, it continued to develop and distribute local language reading materials and more for Afghan children and their families. To ensure that even those displaced or living in remote areas could access education, It offered virtual learning opportunities through initiatives like DD Classroom and DD Courses.  Additionally, it provided professional development to displaced school leaders and teachers. It aimed to enhance free and open resources like the Darakht-e Danesh Digital Library. It made education more accessible to all Afghan children, youth, and adults in Afghanistan and beyond. [i] [2]  Technology for Education: The organization believes technology can be a powerful tool to help people exercise their right to education. Everyone should have access to education, and their Technology for Education Program provides innovative tools to help Afghan citizens gain knowledge and skills essential for the 21st century. The program's virtual education tools, collectively known as Knowledge Tree or Darakht-e Danesh in Dari, enable thousands of people in Afghanistan and nearby regions to access education.  The FTZ School in Kabul was a local community school that served school-age girls in grades 1-10. The school operated in two shifts and had a budget of $106,000 for 2018; the school had a safe building and classrooms, trained teachers who received ongoing professional development, after-school program instructors, learning resources, school notebooks, pencils, fuel for heat in winter, a growing library, a modern computer lab, a playground, and a learning garden. CW4WAfghan's quality assurance staff also supported the school administration in improving the quality of learning. Furthermore, experienced teachers were connected with junior or new teachers through a unique coaching and mentoring component, and a performance measurement framework has been developed to track progress and identify areas needing improvement. In March 2019, nine girls advanced to the new Grade 11 class, and 368 female students were enrolled. The school employs 16 teachers in the morning and afternoon shifts, and seven teachers provide after-school instruction. Thanks to the Rotary Clubs of Kabul and Germany, the school kitchen has been updated, including a much-needed water purifier.  The Wakhan Initiative for Literacy, Education &amp; Development (WILED) was created to address the need for better education in the remote area of Badakhshan province. The Better Business Society, in response to a request from local activists, collaborated with CW4WAfghan to assess the situation and find ways to help. The project aimed to improve the quality of life and increase the capacity for managing and delivering quality education in Wakhan. The local implementing partner, SALEH, is funded by the Better Business Society and its partner donors. The project included basic literacy classes for women and men and upcoming activities such as life skills, librarianship, and reading mentorship in 2019.  Serving a Broad Community: Learning to read as an adult differs from how children learn to read, as adults must develop automaticity, fluency, and comprehension. It is challenging for adults to achieve a reading speed of at least 45 words per minute. It is similar to a literate person trying to learn a new script, like an English speaker trying to learn Cyrillic. Adults struggle to adjust to recognizing and retaining unknown letters, which is more complicated than children who have brains that are more adaptable to learning new languages and scripts.  Adult Literacy: CW4WAfghan has used a unique approach to teaching adult literacy based on Dr. Helen Abadzi's perceptual learning method. Dr. Abadzi, a cognitive psychologist, uses evidence from neuroscience to understand how adults learn reading, and her method has been tested in multiple languages and script combinations in different countries. In 2019, CW4WAfghan tested the technique for the first time in Afghanistan under Dr. Abadzi's guidance and achieved consistently better results than other methods. The approach emphasized repeated practice to gain automaticity, and teachers were trained to guide students in literacy classrooms.  In 2018, the CW4WAfghan Community Literacy Classes and Libraries (AR!) The budget was $39,300. This program aimed to support the development of literacy skills among adult women and out-of-school girls in small Afghan village communities. The classes were held in the homes of local women who received a small stipend for hosting and were taught by trained local teachers. The program also provided access to a growing collection of books, life skills training, and hygiene kits. Each class offered basic literacy classes for approximately 25 female students for one year. The project successfully registered 97 literacy students across three classes in the Karte Naw district of Kabul province. The program's goal was to help reinforce literacy skills, nurture a culture of reading, and foster independent, lifelong learning for illiterate Afghan women with few other learning options.  The Darakht-e Danesh Library (DD Library) had a budget of $67,800 in 2018. It was a digital collection of open educational resources (OERs) for Afghan classrooms. The resources included lesson plans, pedagogical tools, exercises, experiments, reading texts, workbooks, curricula, and other materials. Both primary and secondary teachers could access over 3,500 resources in more than 350 subject categories in Dari, Pashto, and English. The library aimed to increase access to quality, locally adapted educational resources, encourage teachers to consult various information sources and support teachers in adapting, creating, and sharing their resources with others. The library had users from all 34 provinces of Afghanistan and over 20 different countries. In 2018, the library added 568 new resources, bringing the total to over 3,500 resources in seven languages, including Dari, Pashto, English, Nooristani, Uzbeki, Swaji, and Munji.  In the budget for 2018, CW4WAfghan allocated $27,000 towards grants for Implementing Partner Organizations and scholarships for students. CW4WAfghan has a long history of working with trusted partners to achieve their goals in critical areas. These grants provided flexible funding to meet unique project needs. Examples of contributions included PARSA's Sisters 4 Sisters (S4S) program, which offered mentorship and personalized attention to at-risk women and girls, the Afghan Children's Songbook project, which aimed to design, produce and print the first edition of Bood Nabood, Traditional Afghan Children's Folktales, Hoopoe Books, which sought to fund the translation, printing and distribution of 3000 Pashai Pashto edition of a children's storybook for Pashai speaking children in Afghanistan, and the Shafia Fund, established in memory of the three young Shafia sisters and their aunt from Kingston, ON, with funds given as scholarships to female students for study.  Afghanistan Policy Dialogue, Amplifying Afghan Women's Voices: The Afghanistan Policy Dialogue Program (APDP) was created to address the growing threats to the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan during negotiations with the Taliban in February 2020 when the Doha Agreement was signed. As of August 2021, the program's primary focus has been advocating for restoring education rights for women and girls in Afghanistan, ensuring their safe passage out of the country, and evacuating those at risk. The APDP also emphasizes the importance of Afghan women's voices, views, and experiences by amplifying the voices of women activists on Canadian and international platforms in hopes that their demands will be recognized and met. To stay updated on how the CW4WA can help Afghan women, check out the CW4WA Advocacy Page. It provides letter-writing templates, social media posts, and other resources to engage its members, partners, and chapter networks in spreading the message of Afghan women's demands. Additionally, it offers an Advocacy Toolkit, hosts events and campaigns, and provides up-to-date information. The organization also helps Afghan women's networks and activists reach policy-makers and collaborates with like-minded organizations in Canada and globally.  Public Engagement: CW4WAfghan members promote social justice and women's rights in Afghanistan and beyond. They strive to raise awareness and funds to support Afghan women and girls through various activities. Their efforts reflect a commitment to global citizenship and solidarity in creating positive change.  Grants and Scholarships: The CW4WA Grants and Scholarships program promotes education by supporting partners and individuals making a positive impact. The program has three main components: The Shafia Fund, which provides scholarships to Afghan women pursuing higher education and facing financial hardships; Remote Communications Assistance, which supplies devices and internet connectivity for virtual learning; and Small Grants, which provides funding for partner organizations in Afghanistan whose projects align with its objectives. Additionally, the program awards the annual Champion for Education in Afghanistan Award to recognize exceptional individuals, projects, programs, and organizations that have made significant contributions to supporting education for girls and women in Afghanistan.  Supporting At-Risk Afghans: The events of August 2021 caused turmoil in Afghanistan, leading millions of Afghans to leave their country. Many more are expected to follow suit in the coming months and years. [ii]  [5]  CW4WAfghan was established in 1998. Since then, It has trained over 10,000 teachers, provided literacy classes for almost 5,000 students, distributed nearly 300 school library starter kits, established 40 community libraries and 262 science labs, and shared numerous resources through our Darakht-e Danesh Digital Library.

Pp;7–12: https://cw4wafghan.ca/governance/  Analysis and Lessons Learned  To improve literacy skills, it is important to practice reading consistently. Encouraging a love for reading can enhance literacy culture. The CW4WA literacy classes provide classroom libraries with books in the local language and for all levels, and they believe literacy should be integrated into learners' lives outside of school. To achieve this, CW4CA provides access to relevant materials, such as the life skills curriculum, which is incorporated into the literacy program for their students. ""I learned more about teaching methods and techniques. Thanks to this training, our capacity is built up, and our knowledge is increased."" One program participant said.  Literacy teacher trainee: Acquiring foundational literacy skills through literacy classes can pave the way for formal education for both men and women. For this reason, literacy classes must be designed with a purposeful structure that promotes a smooth transition into regular school. The AR! project utilized a tool called the Personal Learning Plan to achieve this goal. Moreover, literacy skills have an intergenerational impact. Research indicates that literate mothers raise literate daughters. To foster this link between parental literacy and support for children's education, the project included strategies that encouraged women to read to their children.  Having a private space like a library is crucial for women to interact with other women, share ideas, and gain independence. Community involvement is essential for CW4WAfghan's library projects, as they only open libraries when communities invite them and have no significant security concerns. Cost-sharing is also encouraged to promote community ownership, where the community contributes to the library and literacy centre space. Additionally, the project focused on providing mentorship, training, and monitoring to teachers to promote reading and library usage through hands-on pedagogy and exposure visits to libraries. [i] [3]  It is sad to mention that Afghanistan's education system has experienced a significant setback despite 20 years of dedicated efforts to improve it. This is due to the Taliban's return to power on August 15, 2021. Unfortunately, the Taliban has prohibited Afghan women and girls from pursuing education and work, causing a devastating blow. Consequently, Afghan women are currently living under the same restrictions as they did in 1996.[i]  Candian Women for Women in Afghanistan.

Specifically, their focus is on creating safe spaces for children to read. Additionally, they have been actively involved in providing humanitarian relief and assistance in Afghanistan since 2003.  Access to education is a fundamental human right, and the Constitution of Afghanistan (2004) ensures this right for all citizens. Over the years, the number of girls enrolled in primary schools has risen from zero (0) in 2001 to 2.8 million in 2018. External funding has significantly impacted education spending, accounting for approximately 49% in 2020. Nevertheless, while there has been notable progress, specific challenges remain concerning access, learning, and outcomes. Recent research indicates a need for early learning opportunities, enhancing the qualifications of teaching staff and providing better-quality learning experiences. [i] [1], lack of school buildings and library Facilities, Long-term Conflict, Poverty, child marriage, and forced marriage prevented them from getting full access to free education or ensuring adequate learning quality.  According to research, in 2015, there were approximately 18000 schools in Afghanistan, but only 10 percent had a school library. The project's goal was to improve the quality of education by promoting library activities in elementary schools and public libraries in Afghanistan.

This project has been ongoing in Afghanistan since 2013, with the support of MoIC.[i]  Shantee Volunteer Association website:  https://sva.or.jp/english/activity/afghanistan/#activityOrganizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Since SVA was established, it has worked as an international Organization to create a culture of learning among targeted countries collaborating for essential support that differs from place to place to social circumstances. Countries that SVA has worked with include: Afghanistan, Nepal,Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Thai, Burma Refugee Camp (Myanmar) Japan.  SVA has two types of funding resources:The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (MoFA) and Japan Platform (JPF) have provided government funding sources.  Private funding sources include companies, associations, and individuals through donations.Specializations, Methods, and ToolsSVA has worked with the Afghan government to carry out projects in distant and rural regions of Afghanistan. These projects aimed to provide humanitarian support to locals who have not received such assistance before.  The Children's Library projects in Afghanistan have been implemented in these central provinces: (Nangahar, Kabul, Konar, Bamiyan, Balkh, and Heart).  Targeted Population:  The project provides access Library to public and private primary schools for students in first through sixth grade. Additionally, children of various ages and perspectives have benefited from the public and private libraries involved in the project. Teachers, library staff, ministries staff, and focal points are also involved.  Major Projects and EventsHere is an example of SVA efforts and library activities:On February 13, 2017, SVA held a “ Library Skills training program ” workshop in Bamiyan, made possible by funding from the International Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA). ADRA is a well-known international humanitarian organization that operates in over 107 countries, focusing on health, education, livelihood, and emergency relief. SVA implemented the program in the ADRA regional office in Bamiyan response efforts. [i]  [4]  In this project, SVA's role was limited to conducting the workshop, while ADRA took charge of funding, organizing, selecting participants, evaluating, and reporting. This project marked SVA's first experience with a partnership program for the children's library project in Bamiyan, which involved collaborating with other international organizations, including ADRA in Afghanistan.  This project targeted Zarin and Kart-e-Sulh schools, encompassing a diverse range of participants in age, gender, educational background, and profession. The group comprised 33 individuals, including teachers, trainers, principals, and three administrative employees.  from ADRA. The workshop's objective was to encourage library activities for children in Bamiyan, and it was conducted using a Q&amp;A format. Practical exercises were also implemented to facilitate comprehension and individual development. After the workshop, ADRA awarded participants with a Certificate of Completion following workshop evaluation.Workshops Agenda : It was designed to continue for three days, and it was focused on the following topics:Day 1Introduction to SVA activities,  The need to create libraries for Children,  Why are picture books and legends chosen for children?  Types of libraries,  Storytelling and its benefits,  Teamwork (Question &amp; Answer),  Value of images in legendary texts,  The procedure of reading stories in comic books,  Story reading practice,  Advantages of using school libraries,  On verification and games for children,  Prepare ground crafts for children in the library averment.  Teamwork (Questions &amp; Answers)Day 2A brief overview of the first-day topics,  Methods of reading skills progress in Afghanistan,  Capabilities and life skills,  Children and Psychology,  Positive and negative effects of this phenomenon in schools, families, and society,  Teamwork (Questions &amp; Answers)  The overall conclusion and knowledge exchange.  What type of employee should be hired at the Children's Library?  The main principles for librarians,  General duties of a librarian,  Telling stories through mental games,  Teamwork (Questions &amp; Answers)  Storytelling by handcraft.Day 3A brief overview of the second day,  The unique feature of the librarians,  Borrowing Books from the Escrow system,  Methods of using the Library,  Exploring the influence of storytelling on children's mental development.  Teamwork (Questions &amp; Answers,  Paper's theatre and practice,  Processing of making paper theatre books,  Using the library assessment forms,  Storytelling practice &amp; Use of the paper theatre box,  Teamwork and overall conclusion of the workshop.During the program, Sultana Safi, the trainer from SVA Library, thoroughly explained the concept and ensured that the participants comprehensively understood the materials. Safi emphasized the importance of the Children's Library in enhancing children's learning skills and how to cater to their needs. Furthermore, the librarian must undergo training on handling and treating them. During her presentation, Sultana emphasized the importance of developing storytelling skills and allowed volunteer participants to practice these skills in a mental game format in front of the class. She also addressed the significant correlation between Psychology and Children, explaining that understanding children's behaviour and capacity for learning knowledge and consciousness is critical. Sultana  highlighted the usefulness of paper theatre as a tool for children's learning, noting that it helps them quickly and memorably grasp concepts through pictures and colours.  Following each session, the trainer grouped the class into smaller teams to encourage collaboration. The participants brainstormed their ideas, developed concepts, and committed to supporting each other. The class policy emphasized open discussion, allowing everyone to share their experiences and stories freely. Overall, the exchange of ideas was encouraged and valued.  Bamiyan's lack of a school library posed a challenge for children and experts trying to establish a stable library system. However, following a workshop, evaluations revealed that most participants recognized the importance of libraries for children in enhancing the quality of education for those in school and those without access to libraries.  The program had 33 participants, 13 of whom were female and 20 were male. Some school principals were essential in sharing their ideas and making decisions. Meanwhile, the class was divided into five groups, and each group presented their ideas and opinions about how storytelling can benefit children.  Upon completion of the program, theParticipants made the following commitments:  To support the process and its goals  To encourage children in families, schools, and society to visit the children's Library and improve their skills.  To recognize the vital role of children's libraries and their positive impact on learning  Many of them requested story picture books, which SVA later provided.  They also requested establishing a children's library section inside the Bamiyan public library.  Established Library in 16 schools that had no library and provided and recruited a librarian for Kart-e-Sulh school,  They Requested to conduct more workshops and seminars in this regard.  [ii] [3]Balkh Province:  SVA's primary objectives in Mazar-e-Sharif City, Balkh province, were to create libraries for children and provide the necessary equipment. After discussing with the Library Director and holding various meetings, SVA sent their team on October 18, 2016, to address the requirements. They successfully established a library at Balkh public building and reserved a designated room. The technical team from SVA was responsible for installation and decoration. Following this, a three-day workshop was conducted for the Mawlana Khasta public library librarians on September 25, 2016.  Three days' workshop agenda was included:Primary Responsibilities of Children Librarian and Criteria,  Children's Library and Methods of Use,  Storytelling through handcrafts and Picture books impacts quality learning.The Library was officially established during an inauguration party on September 30, 2016. The library director gave the opening speech, welcoming guests and committing to supporting the initiative. Regional and international media, such as Ashna TV Broadcasting Channel in the USA and Balkh Regional Radio/TV reporters, were invited to cover the event. The board of the Directorate awarded the SVA team an Appreciation Letter as a way of recognizing their efforts.  Herat province:  In 2016, SVA collaborated with the Ministry of Information and Culture to establish a children's Library in Herat's public library building. The team travelled to Herat, installed, and decorated the room, furnished it with quality books and learning materials, and conducted a three-day workshop for the librarians.  Three days' workshop agenda was included:Primary Responsibilities of Children Librarian and specific criteria,  Children's Library and Methods of Use,  Storytelling through handcrafts and Picture books impacts quality learning.  Challenges:  Weak coordination among Afghan stakeholders in this province,  Security concern: A suicide bomber attacked and exploded in the city. Thus, the deadly explosions delayed the process.Due to security concerns, the library was inaugurated without the government authorities and October 13, 2016.

Analysis and Lessons Learned  The key to sustainable development is quality learning. People can gain knowledge and learn together when a society is peaceful and harmonious. SVA has collaborated with other Afghan government agencies to create a platform for Afghans to thrive in a society that is filled with complex issues. Furthermore, the project was intended to embrace diverse values and ideas and encourage dialogue to coexist peacefully with others. [i] [2] Meanwhile, the Children's Library assisted children in improving their reading skills. An enthusiastic librarian must attract children and be comfortable while learning.  [ii] [5]  The importance of the Children's Library cannot be overstated, especially in Afghanistan, where children have been lacking learning resources for many years. Using new and innovative teaching tools can significantly enhance the learning experience. The evaluation report showed that library projects in Mazar, including picture books and paper theatre concepts, significantly impacted children's learning and motivation. Thus, found it fascinating. The library provides a platform for children to have peace of mind, know how to read and write and explore new learning materials to make a bright future.[i]  Shantee Volunteer Association website:  https://sva.or.jp/english/activity/afghanistan/#activity[ii]  Osu Children’s Library Fund:  www.osuchildrenslibraryfund.caPublicationsLibraries beyond Border, Shanti Volunteer Association, 2011.

12416,organization,Disability-Inclusive Climate Action Research Programme,https://participedia.net/organization/12416,The Disability Inclusive Climate Action Research Programme  DICARP  is a organization based at McGill University that seeks to centre the voices of people with disabilities in the climate movement. DICARP works at the intersection of the disability and climate movements.,0,2023-04-14,2023-06-19,423507,sarah.gillies,https://participedia.net/user/423507,423507,sarah.gillies,https://participedia.net/user/423507,en,,,Montreal,Quebec,,Canada,45.5018869,-73.5673919,higher_ed,,,,informal, research,,facilitate, inform,,disability, climate, abilitydisability,human, environment,,," Mission and PurposeThe Disability-Inclusive Climate Action Research Programme  (DICARP)  aims to bring together scholars and activists from the climate movement and the disability movement to “generate, co-produce, share, and translate knowledge” [1] about respecting and protecting the rights of people with disabilities in climate change action. DICARP was founded in response to the limited amount of research about disability rights and climate change; they realize the gap in knowledge about the unique impacts of climate change on people with disabilities leads to climate action strategies that are inequitable, ineffective, and violate the human rights of people with disabilities [2]. DICARP also recognizes the valuable perspective people with disabilities bring to climate change discussions and aims to ensure its initiatives are led by and accessible to people with disabilities. Furthermore, DICARP approaches climate change with an intersectional lens, which considers the overlapping effect of different forms of oppression, including disability, race, sex, age, queerness, indigeneity, and others [1].InEnabling Commons  , a podcast ( by the McGill Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism)which DICARP shares on its website , DICARP’s director and co-founder, Dr. Sébastien Jodoin, explains DICARP has three main prongs: first, they use the disability rights framework to examine the effects of climate change on people with disabilities; second, they review and influence national and international climate policies in cooperation with other organizations, including the International Disability Alliance (IDA); and third, they centre the voices and knowledge of people with disabilities in climate change conversations [3].A definition of disability-inclusive climate action is helpful in understanding DICARP’s mission. In an opinion piece, Jodoin et al. describe three conditions of disability-inclusive climate action [2]. First, action must be led by scholars, activists, and others with disabilities who have lived experience of ableism and other forms of oppression. Second, climate research must consider and align with the priorities of people with disabilities to avoid violations of their rights. Third, co-produced knowledge must be made accessible to people with disabilities to facilitate their involvement in climate action. Jodoin et al. emphasize that disability-inclusive climate action requires people to recognize the value of diverse forms of knowledge, including lived experience and community-based research. The IDA adds that disability-inclusive climate action ensures the engagement of people with disabilities and disability rights language in climate change education and awareness [4].Knowledge co-production is a critical component of disability-inclusive climate action. Jodoin et al. assert that climate research should be guided by the disability rights movement motto, “Nothing about us without us” [2]. Knowledge co-production can be defined as the creation of knowledge through research and other processes that involve a diverse group of people, perspectives, and experiences [5]. Thus, successful co-production of knowledge is highly participatory. Climate change, in particular, demands knowledge co-production that balances scientific and local knowledge [6].Origins and DevelopmentDICARP was co-founded by Dr. Sébastien Jodoin, associate professor in the Faculty of Law of McGill University and Canada Research Chair in Human Rights, Health, and the Environment [7]. Jodoin had been a human rights and climate change activist, scholar, and lawyer for 15 years, focusing on the role of human rights in compelling governments to reduce their emissions and preventing the disproportionate harm of groups, particularly Indigenous communities, when he was diagnosed with relapsing Multiple Sclerosis and suddenly became a member of the disabled community—a group disproportionately affected by climate change [3]. At the time of his diagnosis, Jodoin was co-editing a book about human rights and climate change, which included a chapter on women’s rights, children’s rights, and Indigenous rights; yet, it failed to mention disability rights. Jodoin was introduced to a major gap in research about disability rights and climate change, as well as limited inclusion of members of the disabled community in the climate movement. He co-founded DICARP, with Dr. Yolanda Muñoz, associate member of the McGill Centre for Human Rights &amp; Legal Pluralism and faculty lecturer at the McGill Institute for Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies, in an effort to fill that gap and increase disability inclusion [8].DICARP continues to collaborate with other disability rights organizations to conduct research, publish reports, and create awareness about disability-inclusion in the climate movement. Their actions centre and are led by people with disabilities.Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingDICARP is a collaborative organization led by the Canada Research Chair in Human Rights, Health, and the Environment and  the McGill Centre for Human Rights &amp; Legal Pluralism. It is  based out of McGill University and funded by the McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [1]. DICARP has a core team of investigators and research associates, as well as a larger advisory network/panel.DICARP’s core team includes [7]:Dr. Sébastien Jodoin (director and co-founder): associate professor in the Faculty of Law of McGill University and Canada Research Chair in Human Rights, Health, and the EnvironmentDr. Nandini Ramanujam (co-investigator): associate professor in McGill University’s Faculty of Law and the executive director of the Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism (CHRLP)Dr. Alexis Buettgen (co-investigator): has an academic background in community psychology and critical disability studies and focuses on community-engagementMathieu Simard: PhD candidate in Rehabilitation Sciences at McGill University whose research focuses on disability-inclusive approaches to disaster risk reduction and climate adaptationKatherine Lofts (research associate): member of the Canada Research Chair in Human Rights, Health, and the EnvironmentDICARP’s advisory panel brings together disability and climate activists and scholars from around the world [3]. The diverse panel helps ensure that DICARP’s research is aligned with the experiences and needs of people with disabilities [9, 10].Advisory panel:Francisco Bariffi: Universidad Nacional de Mar del PlataKarina Chupina: International Federation of Hard of Hearing Young PeopleLouise Fournier: GreenpeacePatrick Fugeyrollas: L’Égalité et l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap (INÉÉI–PSH) &amp; Université LavalPratima Gurung: Indigenous Persons with Disabilities Global NetworkCarlos Kaiser: ONG InclusivaMary Keogh: CBM GlobalSelma Khoudiri: L’Égalité et l’Inclusion des personnes en situation de handicap (INÉÉI–PSH)Anna Lawson: University of LeedsSetareki Macanawai: Pacific Disability ForumDianah Msipa: Centre for Human Rights, Umiversity of PretoriaDr. Yolanda Muñoz:  University of McGill  Dr. Yolanda Muñoz is a co-founder of the Disability-Inclusive Climate Action Research Programme  Ipul Powaseu: Papua New Guinea Assembly of Disabled Persons  Shivaun Quinlivan: NUI Galway  Gordon Rattray: European Disability Forum  Marcie Roth: World Institute on DisabilityNkhasi Sefuthi: Lesotho National Federation of Organisations of the Disabled (LNFOD)Jewelles Smith: Council of Canadians with DisabilitiesFatma Wangare: Kenya Association of the Intellectually Handicapped (KAIH)Elham Youssefin: International Disability AllianceSpecializations, Methods and ToolsDICARP conducts research; collaborates with other organizations; shares the latest news about disability-inclusive climate action on their website; organizes educational events to share knowledge; and uses a podcast,Enabling Commons  , to facilitate discussions about disability and climate changes.As Jodoin mentioned in the first episode ofEnabling Commons,DICARP has three main prongs [3]. Each prong involves a variety of methods and tools: The first prong (using the disability rights framework to examine the effects of climate change on people with disabilities) is the focus of DICARP’s research and publications, which is conducted by DICARP’s team and advisory panel, sometimes in collaboration with other climate or disability-focused organizations. The second prong (reviewing and influencing national and international climate policies in cooperation with other organizations) is also achieved through DICARP’s research, reports, and collaboration with other organizations.The third prong (centring the voices and knowledge of people with disabilities in climate change conversations) is particularly achieved through DICARP’s events and theEnabling Commonspodcast. DICARP’s events, including webinars, forums, and side events of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26, COP14), highlight disability rights in climate change discussions and feature the voices of people with disabilities. TheEnabling Commonspodcast was established to figure people with disabilities as knowers, makers and doers in the climate movement [3]. One of the podcast’s goal is to combat the dominant tendency of academia and media to emphasize the vulnerability of people with disabilities; instead,Enabling Commonshighlights their knowledge and contribution to the climate movement.DICARP ensures its research, reports, and events are accessible to people with disabilities to promote education about the climate among members of the disabled community. Education helps people with disabilities to understand their rights relative to climate change and engage with the climate movement. By ensuring accessibility to informational events and publications, DICARP removes lack of education as a barrier to participation in the climate movement for people with disabilities.Major Projects and EventsDICARP’s most recent projects include:Nothing about us without us: The urgent need for disability-inclusive climate research[3]: an opinion piece that explains the need for disability-inclusive climate action and describes a vital component of this inclusion is thorough, participatory research on the intersections of disability and climate change.Systematic Analysis of Disability Rights in Canadian Climate Policies[11]: a report about the inclusion of disability rights in Canadian climate policies adopted at the federal, provincial, and municipal levels.Disability Rights in National Climate Policies: Status Report[12]: a report (released in collaboration with the IDA) which outlines the obligations of states to protect the rights of people with disabilities under international law; provides an analysis of disability inclusion in states’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); and makes recommendations for improving disability inclusion in climate actions.DICARP’s most recent events include:Anofficial Side Event at COP26[13]: focused on disability-inclusive climate action and featured eight participants from different organizations pertaining to climate change, human rights, and disability rights.A webinar with the Disability &amp; Philanthropy Forum: discussed the intersections between disability and climate change, as well as philanthropy’s role in community-based solutions, aimming to support members of the disabled community to produce knowledge and bring together disability, climate, and human rights philanthropists and advocates.Disability Futures: an event in collaboration with Sins Invalid (a disability justice organization) and  Movement Generation Justice &amp; Ecology Project (a  climate justice organization) which involved a discussion about climate justice and disability justice, as well as Sins Invalid’s performanceWe Love Like Barnacles  .A 2021 Economic and Social Committee Humanitarian Affairs Segment Side Event: organized byUNICEFandIDA  , which participation from DICARP's advisory panel. Young people with disabilities were involved in a discussion about how people with disabilities can participate in local climate action and how to strengthen their ability to be advocates.More of DICARP’s research, publications, and events can be found on their website.Analysis and Lessons Learned  Despite there being a limited amount of research on the intersection of disability and climate change, existing publications in this space can be used to evaluate the relevance of DICARP's goals and efficacy of their methods.Eco-ableism is discrimination against people with disabilities that is specific to actions and attitudes related to the environment and climate change. Eco-ableism involves and reinforces the assumption that there is a correct form of the human body, which creates rigid concepts of health that pathologize people whose bodies deviate from the accepted norm [14]. Eco-ableism enables the exclusion of people with disabilities from climate discussions and allows able-bodied people to act as leaders, protectors, and saviors for people with disabilities—who are figured as dependent and vulnerable  [14] . Given the prevalence of eco-ablism, DICARP’s goal to re-figure people with disabilities as knowers in the climate space is significant because it prompts people with disabilities to be included and heard in conversations. DICARP emphasizes the importance of co-producing knowledge, which requires the participation of people with disabilities. Sins Invalid, a disability justice organization which DICARP has collaborated with, also highlights the wisdom that people with diverse experiences bring to the climate movement and holds that all bodies, human, animal, and planetary, are valuable [15].The United Nations (UN) released a report that reviews existing data and provides recommendations to promote the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for people with disabilities [16]. In regard to people with disabilities, the report highlights barriers to participation in community life; disproportionate levels of poverty; limited access to education, health services and employment; and underrepresentation in decision-making. The primary barriers that prevent people with disabilities from participating in their communities, according to the UN’s findings, are discrimination, stigma, and lack of accessibility. Regarding discrimination and stigma, DICARP figures people with disabilities as knowers, which helps promote their participation in the climate movement. DICARP also ensures that their events and publications are accessible to promote education.Many of the recommendations in the UN's report align with DICARP’s objectives and methods, although the recommendations in the report are more specific to natural disasters and risk reduction. Some of the UN’s suggested next steps include: ensuring that emergency information is inclusive and available in accessible formats; raising awareness among persons with disabilities on disaster management planning at the local level; enhancing the knowledge of aid workers on the needs and strengths of persons with disabilities; and undertaking evidence-based research about persons with disabilities relevant to conflicts and disasters [16]. These recommendations describe some of the work DICARP is accomplishing in the climate space more generally, rather than specifically in the context of natural disasters.Kett et al. released a report under the Open Society Foundations (the largest private funder of independent groups working on human rights, democratic governance, or justice) following the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 26) [17]. From their literature review, Kett et al. found very few examples of effective partnerships between the climate movement and disability movement, as well as a lack of research about the specific impacts of climate change on people with disabilities. The report contains recommendations, including improving intersectional understandings of climate and disability issues; developing a rights-based view that connects climate justice and disability rights; increasing disability representation in climate justice networks; conducting more research on the intersection between climate and disability; and supporting disability activists to be leaders and share their knowledge, which align with DICARP's goals. The report recognizes DICARP’s contribution to disability-inclusive climate action and describes DICARP as being “instrumental in bringing together activists and advocates around the climate agenda” (p 32). According to Kett et al., DICARP’s advisory panel is well-comprised and includes “most, if not all, of the key players identified for this research” (p 32). The report also notes DICARP’s successful collaboration with other disability and climate organizations.Larrington-Spencer et al. also note the limited research about climate change and disability rights; furthermore, they explain the disabled body is a killjoy in the climate movement [18]. The climate-related challenges that face people with disabilities highlight inequalities in accessibility. However, in advocating for better accessibility, the disabled community may be seen as trying to draw attention away from mainstream climate concerns. Larrington-Spencer et al. argue there needs to be more space for disability studies scholars in environmental research and policy making. Aligned with DICARP’s mission, Larrington-Spencer et al. assert the disabled body should be centralized in the climate movement; yet, according to Larrington-Spencer et al., academia plays a significant role in the limited presence of disability. Academia insists on a high level of efficiency and productivity, and members of the academic community must be high performing [18]. Cram et al. explain that to participate in academia, people with disabilities must either overcome their disabilities or figure themselves as an exception, rather than changing the norms of productivity [14]. The exclusion of scholars with disabilities from academia is social injustice and a loss to academia: lived experiences and valuable perspectives are overlooked [18]. The exclusion of the disabled community results in a loss of knowledge; Bell et al. argues that disability must be recognized as an ordinary component of the human experience rather than abnormal or exceptional: disability is a spectrum that every person is on [19]. The exclusion of people with disabilities and their experience from academia highlights the importance of DICARP's mission (to frame  people with disabilities as knowers in the climate movement)  and methods (such as publishing scholarly work by disability scholars on their advisory panel).In addition to lacking participation in academia, when the disabled community is mentioned by able-bodied scholars in academic spaces, they are often labeled as a vulnerable group [20]. The assumption that people with disabilities are dependent, vulnerable, and weak further hinders their ability to participate in the climate movement because it diverts attention away from their potential contribution. Kelly-Costello argues people with disabilities are expert adapters: living in a society designed for a particular type of body gives people whose bodies deviate from the norm numerous opportunities to problem solve and adapt [20]. Therefore, the lived experience of people with disabilities is valuable knowledge in the pursuit of climate change solutions.There are multiple arguments for the unique knowledge that people with disabilities can contribute to the climate movement. Besler explains that people with disabilities have experience living with limitation, pain, uncertainty, and change, which is vital knowledge for navigating climate change [21]. Disabled communities have experience in creating support networks and adaptation strategies, which may be helpful in dealing with challenges created by climate change. Eriksen et al. adds that people with disabilities may be more apt to problem solve and embrace diversity; thus, the knowledge of people with disabilities may be helpful to foster resilience [22]. These perspectives provide support for DICARP’s mission by reinforcing the need to centre disabled voices in the climate movement and recognize people with disabilities as knowers.Expanding on the argument that people with disabilities bring valuable knowledge to the climate movement, Belser argues that insights from the disability justice movement, namely the ability to reconfigure how impairment is recognized, can be useful in the climate movement [21]. In society, there is a tendency to make disability invisible; however, in many disabled communities, disability is embraced and claimed as an important part of a person's identity. Similar to disability, environmental damage is often made invisible by powerful institutions. Both disability activists and climate activists struggle with being overlooked by people who are unaffected by disability or climate change respectively [21], although both disability and climate change can affect anyone at any point in life. Belser draws multiple parallels between the disability and climate movements that highlight how disability and climate activists may benefit from working together, which provides support for DICARP’s methods of bringing together scholars and activists from both movements.However, Besler also illuminates deeply ingrained cultural practices which hinder DICARP's work—namely the tendency for people to ignore disability and climate change if they are not directly affected by these issues  [21] . While DICARP's efforts may help the disabled community be more involved in the climate movement, there are many systemic challenges that face the disability justice movement, the climate movement, and the intersection between the two.While the participation of people with disabilities in research and policy-making is a vital component of disability-inclusive climate action, it does not entail their full inclusion in society [23]. Ableism continues to reproduce barriers and inequalities for people with disabilities in society at large  [23] . Lahsen explains that participation is only a component of combating oppression [24]. Participation is necessary to understand the needs of people with disabilities, but it does not, alone, correct power imbalances and economic inequalities. While ending ableism may be beyond the scope of DICARP’s mission, ableism, namely eco-ableism, hinders the inclusion of people with disabilities in the climate movement, which is DICARP's goal. General stereotypes about people with disabilities being less capable may prevent them from being figured as knowers in the climate space. Without having knowledge or being socially recognized as having knowledge, participation in society is challenging [25].Ultimately, there is support for the relevance of DICARP's mission and evidence that suggests their methods are appropriate in the context of their goal as a participatory organization. However, ableism is a persisting form of oppression that acts at systemic and individual levels. While DICARP's mission concerns the climate movement, this space cannot be separated from society as a whole; therefore, it is important to acknowledge the challenges associated with ableism that hinder the participation of people with disabilities in society at large, including the climate movement.

He faced hate speech, discrimination, and violence due to his ethnicity in Rhino Refugee Settlement, Uganda, where he sought refuge.  After finding safety in Koboko and becoming a Christian evangelist, Patrick found a new purpose – to help bridge divides and unite refugee communities for peace, reconciliation, and tolerance. In May 2017, while serving as a full-time Evangelist of Koboko Seventh-Day Adventist Church, he founded the Community Empowerment for Creative Innovation – CECI Uganda, to tackle conflict tensions and ethnic cleavages arising from ethnic discrimination, cultural intolerance, hate speech, resource access and utilization, trauma and limited employment opportunities in refugee communities.  He mobilized a team of refugees who shared his vision of promoting peace and self-reliance in their communities through education, innovation, and recreational activities. They were from diverse ethnicities, professions, and backgrounds, but all were united in their commitment to fighting discrimination and violence.  On August 14, 2017, Patrick, along with Vita Geofrey, Dominic Wani, Baba Michael Nigo, Juma Robert John Paul, and Hakim Bosco, registered CECI Uganda as a Community-Based Organization (Reg. No. 563/124) with the Koboko District Local Government. Later, they incorporated it as a Company Limited by Guarantee (Reg. No. 80020002697777). This milestone marked a new phase of growth and impact for CECI in preventing, reducing, and transforming conflicts through locally-led innovations in peacebuilding, education, livelihood, and environmental sustainability.  Since then, we have been working with 58,524 youth, women and girls to stop violence and increase social cohesion among and between refugees and host communities. We campaigned against all forms of hate speech and incitement to violence and provided community-based and data-driven solutions to the problem of hate speech, disinformation, and misinformation. We have also strengthened local peace structures to respond to and prevent conflicts, rebuilt the livelihoods of 5,951 youth, women and girls, increased their safety and wellbeing, and improved access to education for over 5000 children.  Our focus on empowering youth and women to participate actively in local leadership, peacebuilding, and development has been unwavering. Today, we have expanded our services to benefit 147,098 refugees and hosts in Koboko, Yumbe, and Obongi districts. We are strengthening their participation by increasing access to education, financial resources, knowledge and skills in conflict resolution and peacebuilding, business, technology, entrepreneurship, and vocational training.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  CECI is run by a team of skilled, competent, and experienced personnel headed by an Executive Director who is Secretary to the Board of Directors – a supreme body of the organization after the General Assembly. The Board, consisting of 5 members, is the custodian of all policies, formulates and reviews them and approves them as laws that the management implements in the interest of the organization.  Specializations, Methods and ToolsPeacebuildingStrengthening the role of youth and women in preventing and resolving conflicts in refugee and host communities by promoting peaceful dispute resolution and reconciliation and building and increasing peaceful coexistence and social cohesion through peace education, hate speech mitigation, media literacy, dialogues, music, trauma healing, community outreach, and conflict management and resolution.EducationImproving primary and accelerated education access for women and girls and early childhood development programs for children by promoting girl child education and early childhood development through advocacy, menstrual hygiene management, public health promotion, children educational radio programming, scholarships and scholastic materials support, and community awareness, education, and empowerment in gender-based violence prevention.LivelihoodBuilding skills that support peace and development, resilience, and employability among youth and women in refugee and host communities through vocational, business, and entrepreneurial skilling, design thinking, women and girls technological empowerment, and the provision of capital to start, scale, and grow their income-generating activities.EnvironmentEngaging youth and women in community-led environmental conservation and climate action in refugee and host communities to promote environmental sustainability by educating communities, promoting tree planting, use of alternative fuel sources, and proper waste disposal and management, and strengthening local environment protection structures through training and grants.Major Projects and EventsCovid-19 Innovation Prize:  CECI has been a leader in the effort to promote peace and respond to the needs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Koboko and Bidibidi Refugee Settlement. In 2020, CECI received the COVID-19 Innovation Prize from the Response Innovation Lab hosted at Save the Children in recognition of CECI’s innovative work and impact in increasing access to information, online schooling, personal protective equipment, and livelihood support for 50,789 youth, children, women and girls, men, elderly, and PWDs and for promoting peaceful coexistence in refugee and host communities.Historic Multi-year Grant:  In January 2020, CECI secured its first 3-year project in partnership with Koboko Municipal Council, funded by the European Union. The ""CRRF: Inclusive Urban Development and Mobility in the Municipality of Koboko"" aims to reduce inequalities, increase safety, and promote well-being within the municipality. To date, this project has positioned CECI as a key player in promoting sustainable development and community empowerment and has empowered 4,524 women, youth, children, students, teachers, and persons with disabilities with knowledge and skills in business, public health, gender-based violence, sports, debating, and provided them with start-up capital.Humanitarian, Development and Peace Nexus:  In 2022, CECI secured two projects as part of its commitment to addressing immediate needs and the underlying factors contributing to conflict and instability in the communities it serves. The first project, a 5-year initiative with War Child Canada and funded by the Master Card Foundation, titled ""Bridge from Secondary education and skills development to job opportunities for refugees and host community youth in Koboko, Uganda"", aims to address high youth unemployment rates by providing 1,242 young people with the necessary skills and training to secure stable employment opportunities. The second project, a 4-year initiative called ""Peacebuilding Initiatives"" with OXFAM, aims to strengthen women's participation in leadership and peacebuilding activities by equipping over 183 women and men with knowledge and skills in gender transformative leadership, human rights, and peacebuilding at the local level.Analysis and Lessons LearnedPublicationshttps://www.ceciuganda.org/ceci-uganda-impact-report-2020-2022/https://www.ceciuganda.org/report-of-the-refugee-women-conference-on-women-participation-and-leadership-in-uganda/https://www.ceciuganda.org/call-for-proposals-for-external-audit-services-for-community-empowerment-for-creative-innovation-ceci-uganda/https://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/ceci-uganda-impact-report-2020-2022https://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/report-refugee-women-conference-women-participation-and-leadership-koboko-uganda-december-2023https://www.rethinkingrefuge.org/articles/recognizing-the-role-of-refugee-led-organizations-in-responding-to-covid-19  https://www.ceciuganda.org/2021/03/08/tales-and-innovations-of-local-actors-in-humanitarian-response/See Also  References  https://www.rethinkingrefuge.org/articles/recognizing-the-role-of-refugee-led-organizations-in-responding-to-covid-19  https://www.ceciuganda.org/2021/03/08/tales-and-innovations-of-local-actors-in-humanitarian-response/  https://reliefweb.int/organization/ceci-uganda  https://www.idealist.org/en/nonprofit/91e3bfd4ae5f47238b161b7c142a3662-community-empowerment-for-creative-innovation-ceci-uganda-koboko  https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk/news/a-refugee-led-response-to-covid-19-in-uganda  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7685637/  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7685637/  https://www.ceciuganda.org/ceci-uganda-profile/  https://www.ceciuganda.org/ceci-uganda-profile/  External Links  Notes ",8,4,4,7,2,,"CECI Uganda promotes peace, self reliance and dignity in refugee and host communities by empowering youth, women, and girls with the tools to build resilience, prevent conflicts, rebuild livelihoods, and participate actively in local leadership, peacebuilding, and development."

The organization not only supports local artists in creating their works, but also promotes arts education across the wider community. By setting up various educational programs for youth and seniors, Centre[3] creates an inclusive and accessible space where art can drive social change within Hamilton.Origins and DevelopmentBefore its rebranding in 2012, Centre[3] was known as The Print Studio, a space dedicated to providing accessible and affordable printmaking services for Hamilton’s local artists. Between its creation in 2003 and its rebranding in 2012, The Print Studio’s mission evolved from a sole focus on printmaking to encompass community education and art activities. With this shift in priorities came a change in the organization’s name and identity. Thus, in 2012, Centre[3] was born.The studio currently features top-notch traditional printmaking facilities and a high-tech digital media studio. Pieces from emerging and established artists, both local and international, are exhibited in Centre [3]’s main gallery. This studio also has a separate area where exclusive local works are displayed for their members.In addition to their in-studio offerings, Centre[3]’s staff use educational and outreach initiatives to connect with Hamilton Wentworth communities. To date, the organization’s innovative approach to teaching has helped thousands of children and youth in Hamilton.Highlights through the years:2004:incorporated and received charitable status2005:gallery and printmaking studio became available to the public2008:opened a digital studio to members2011:expanded the number of studios/editing spaces available to members2012:developed Nu Steel, a social enterprise program for at-risk youth2013:partnered with Hamilton Wentworth District School Board to run parallel program entitled Nu Steel2014 onwards:expanded media arts centre, presented at Function Keys2, piloted new professional development program with McMasterOrganizational Structure, Membership, and FundingOrganizational Structure of Centre[3]Centre[3] is run by a dedicated board of directors who each bring a unique perspective and skillset to the team.

Areas of focus include film production, film equipment rental, production &amp; post-production tech support, video enhancement support, and audio booth.iv. WorkshopsCentre[3] routinely hosts workshops for members and guests to participate in where experienced instructors are brought in to teach specialized skills. The skills taught in these workshops range, including but not limited to, various types of printwork, creative writing, and even some skills within the realm of performance arts.Listed below are some of the workshops held by Centre[3]:Critical Art Writing with Saelan Twerdy (December 12, 2022)Podcasting with Rebecca Casalino (November 5, 2022)T-Shirt Printing Workshop (October 5, October 19, November 9, November 23, 2022)v. ProjectsCentre[3] has developed two major projects over the past few years. The first, entitled Stitching a Line Thru Media, was a three-part project that spanned the years 2019-2022, and it involved artists from across North America and Europe. The project focused on ways themes such as nostalgia, identity, and culture can be displayed and discussed through textiles and media art.The project was broken down into three major exhibitions listed below:Year 1: Interweavings (2019)- This exhibit explored themes surrounding the ways in which handmade and mechanized textile production intersect. It also brought together topics such as cultural practice and the widespread impact of technology in our lives.Year 2: Remediations (2021)- This exhibit discussed the development and transformation of technology through textile art. Some artists chose to focus on more contemporary forms of technology, such as e-commerce sites and dating apps, whereas others focused on earlier technological developments, such as the television. Overall, the exhibit discussed how technology is created and designed by those who are impacted by it.Year 3: Transpositions (2022)- This final exhibit of the project exhibited different forms of textile production using elements of technology, such as wires and cords, as the mediums for textile production. In this exhibit, artists communicated using technological materials that hold cultural importance through their chosen medium of textile design.The second major project from Centre[3] is entitled Steal this Poster Exchange 2022. This project originated in Winnipeg at the Martha Street Studio as a marketing strategy and has expanded and been adopted by other art collectives. For Centre[3]’s interpretation, they commission ‘non-partisan protest posters’ that are then hung in various neighborhoods throughout Hamilton, and community members are encouraged to “steal” the posters. This project is a creative take on art dissemination and helps spread the causes and solutions highlighted in the poster artists’ work.vi. Arts ResidenciesThere are four different arts residencies Centre[3] members can apply to.Incite Foundation Residency- 12-week self-directed residency. It gives multidisciplinary artists access to studio time and support to use a variety of different facilities and tools within the centre. The residency ends with an exhibition in the main gallery.Emerging Artist Residency- 12-week self-directed residency. Provides studio time and access to a variety of facilities to artists with under 5 years of exhibition experience.Hamilton-Based Residency- 12-week self-directed residency. Open to all artists in Hamilton, provides access to facilities at the centre. Finishes with an exhibition in a gallery.Centre[3] x Martha Street Studio Residency Exchange- Yearly exchange program with Martha Street Studi in Winnipeg. The artist is sent for two weeks for a residency and access to their studio.vii. SubmissionsArtists can submit their work to multiple shows and galleries at the centre and are also welcome to apply to the above-mentioned residencies.2.Social Practicei.Community artsCentre[3] runs several programs as well that are focused on social impact; however, their four programs of focus are listed and explained in greater detail down below.YouthCAN- Centre[3] and the other involved organizations work to directly support NEET youth by building programming that helps them navigate the job market. Specifically, they provide mentoring and job search training to help NEET youth obtain jobs. This program also provides networking opportunities for participants to meet with hiring companies and peers.360 [4] Youth- This program offers youth ages 15-30 a paid work placement and teaches them digitally-based skills to make them more employable. Skills taught in the workshop include but are not limited to; MS office, social media training, and various soft skills.Direct [Message]- This project is research-based and is aimed at increasing the accessibility of technology for aging individuals in Hamilton, Guelph and London, ON. Through the application of interview-style research, prototype design and the creation of an online community for aging populations, this program is attempting to promote artistic creativity and the use of technology in aging populations in the area[D]irect [M]essage- Community-based art project that aims to share stories from aging individuals who live on Hamilton’s Barton Street. The project shares recordings of these folks’ stories to convey this area's history and cultural richness.ii. Arts educationThrough a number of projects, Centre[3] partners with local school boards to run programming in schools, including NuSteel, their alternative education program. Additionally, they also run several educational programs and run co-op programs that are open to artists so that they may develop their skills.Major Projects and EventsThe more recent major projects, exhibitions, and events are listed above in their respective sections of the Specializations, Methods, and Tools section.Analysis and Lessons LearnedA brief analysis of this organization and its impacts can be accessed here.ReferencesAll information included in this article was sourced from the Centre[3] website.Centre[3].

Additionally, it has aided them in making critical policy and decision-making decisions and,  Organizing RoundtablesOrigins and Development  The NCPR was founded in 2003 on the Campus of Kabul University by collaborating with The Konrad Adenauer Foundation of Germany, the Ministry of Higher Education, and Kabul University. It consisted of four research departments: the Department of Law and Political Science, the Department of Economy, Social Sciences, and the Department of Peace and Conflict.  The NCPR aimed to collaborate with other Afghan Universities, such as Kabul and Herat, and international institutions to exchange knowledge and experience through research. The NSPR has started a partnership program with esteemed German academic institutions to achieve this goal. In Germany, the main partners were the Institute of Development Research and Development Policy (IEE) at Ruhr University in Bochum, as well as the Centre for Development Research (ZEF) at Ruhr-Bochum University, Frankfurt University, Heidelberg University, and the German Afghan Universities cooperation (DAUG). In addition, this center had partnerships with organizations such as German International Cooperation (GIZ), NATO Diplomacy Division, Center of International Private Enterprises (CIPE), Afghanistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Democracy International (DI), Peace Build Canada, Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, German Voice (DW) and Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC).  The NCPR initiated partnership with other Afghan Nongovernmental Organizations. However, many of these organizations have been involved in development projects and social activities without clear and well-thought-out strategies and scientific methods to achieve their goals. By collaborating with NCPR, these organizations enhanced their programs, resulting in more practical projects and better outcomes. The NCPR provided social science courses with research methods and created a database, while NGOs could suggest policies and activities for the well-being of people. Collaboration with national and international partners was crucial for the sustainability and strengthening of the center.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  From the 2003 mission to 2008, the NCPR was part of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung (KAS) Kabul Office during its first- phase. Following 2008, The KAS directly funded the NCPR, with the KAS office in Kabul assessing, spending, and accounting for the NCPR budget. Since 2009, the Centre has operated independently, receiving funding from KAS and directly reporting expenditures to the Office in Berlin. [i] [1][i]  National Centre for Policy Research, official Webpage:  https://www.ncpr.af/  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The NCPR has selected the general director of the Centre from academic members of the Faculties of Law and Political Sciences, Economy, and Social Sciences. The department heads were chosen based on their qualifications through an online interview by KAS from Germany and a face-to-face interview by the NCPR office at Kabul University.  To participate in projects, individuals must have completed the Research Methodology course as an introductory course and met specific criteria, including their educational background, activities, scores, motivations, and related skills. It applied to both professors and students who were selected for these projects. The candidates were introduced officially by the academic administrative office. Successful candidates were responsible for the following activities:Literature review (Senior Professors)  Data Collections, Questionaries (Students). Conducting Interviews (Junior Professors)  Analysis (Senior Professors)  Report Writing (Senior Professors).The NCPR has also focused on selecting a vital research topic for the upcoming years. To do this, the Centre has organized annual consultancy workshops and roundtables. These events brought together scholars, researchers, practitioners, experts, and policymakers in research-related fields to vote for the most critical topics. Each year, the departments within the center undertook at least one research project, with Kabul University scholars and students leading the efforts. The NCPR then distributed the resulting reports to academic institutions, stakeholders, government officials, and anyone interested in Social Science. To date, the NCPR has published and shared over 50 research reports across the country.  Major Projects and Events  The major Projects and Events of NCPR have focused on the following areas:Enhanced capacity building,  Organizing roundtable discussions,  Conducted workshops and seminars,  Publications that have been extensively researched.The departments of Law and Political Sciences, Economy, Social Sciences, and Peace and Conflict Studies held a workshop in 2014 to discuss and vote on the most important and achievable research topics for the following year. The meeting took place in the center building. In 2014, participants evaluated and voted on the issues to be researched, which are listed below:“Administrative Reform and its Role in tackling corruption in Afghanistan"" (Department of Law and Political Sciences,  “Ways of Increasing the income sources in Afghanistan"" Opportunity and Challenges (Department of Economy),  “Corruption in Afghanistan with focus on Kabul Province” (Department of Social Sciences)  ""The Impacts of Media in Peace Building"" (Department of Peace and Conflict Studies).In 2014, the NCPR organized a roundtable on ""Illegal Money, Extortion, and Corruption"" for Private International Enterprises (CIEP) at the Nangarhar province municipality hall. The Workshop included participation from various government officials, private sector representatives, university scholars, students, and civil society members. The discussion revolved around the issue of the illegal extortion of money and corruption within the country, and the participants shared their suggestions and concerns.  In February 2014, NCPR partnered with KAS to conduct a public poll on political and security issues in five provinces of Afghanistan (Kabul, Nangarhar, Balkh, Herat, and Pakteya). The poll had a sample size of 5,000 participants who filled out questionnaires. According to the research reports, 63% of respondents were satisfied with the development of democracy, 46% were satisfied with the government's work, and 37% were confident with parliamentary work. Additionally, 73% said they would participate in the government election on February 5, 2015, while 53% thought the upcoming election needed more transparency. Moreover, 62% of the participants supported signing a security agreement with the US and NATO, and 61% expressed satisfaction with how the international community had assisted Afghanistan.  A conference was held on April 30, 2014, by the Women Regional Network and Equality for Peace and Democracy Organizations, which had technical support from NCPR, at the Kanrod Adenuar Hall in the NCPR building. During the conference, the organization's representative shared their research findings on ""Women's Perspective about Corruption, Peace, Security and Militarization of aids.”The Deputy of the Interior Ministry, civil society representatives, professors, students, and journalists attended the conference.  In May 2014, a ten-day training program in Konar province focused on monograph writing and seminar presentation skills. Approximately 350 students from various fields were attended in the Workshop, such as Economy, Psychology, Pedagogy, and Social Sciences. The program concluded with the presentation of research papers by individual participants. Moreover, the same training program was organized annually at the Faculty of Social Sciences at Kabul University. [i] [2][i]  National Centre for Policy Research, annual report, 2014.Pp:1-5.  The Department of Peace and Conflict Studies at NCPR organized a workshop on Nonviolent Communication and Restorative Circle at Kabul University. This program allowed students to learn new skills in positive thinking, peaceful behaviour, and attitude. Approximately 120 students, both male and female, benefited from the program.  The Department of Peace and Conflict, in partnership with several Afghan and International Civil Society organizations, initiated A Pathway to Peace Process to enhance the capacity of the Afghan Civil Society for peacebuilding, reconciliation, and dialogue. This process is supported by an international consortium of organizations, including the National Centre for Policy Research, Kabul University; the Afghan Civil Society Forum (ACSF); CARE, Afghanistan; the Women Activities &amp; Social Services Association (WASSA); Cooperation for Peace and Unity (CPAU) Afghanistan; Peacebuilding: the Canadian peacebuilding network; the 3D Security Initiative, Washington, D.C.; Concordis International, Cambridge, U.K.; The Group of 78, Ottawa; Project Ploughshares, Waterloo, Canada; and MATCH International. The initiative is also supported by the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict (GPPAC) and the Alliance for Peacebuilding (AfP). As part of McMaster's efforts to promote peace in Afghanistan, Dr. Seddiq Weera led the research to identify the root causes of the conflict and propose solutions for reconciliation. This research is part of the Afghanistan: Pathways to Peace project, which supports civil society-led approaches to peacebuilding.  The main goals of this initiative were to encourage and assist Afghan-led efforts for official and unofficial peace processes at community, national, and regional levels. It also aimed to establish a coordinating mechanism for civil society to promote peacebuilding and reconciliation in Afghanistan. Additionally, the initiative conducted practical research to address conflict issues and communicate with policy-makers to support peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts. The research focused on critical issues related to substantive and process-related conflicts.Dreams for Afghanistan  Biggest Injustices at present  Ethnic Grievances Related to Past Injustices  Healing the Wounds and Preventing Further Injustice  Foreign Influence and Foreign Relations  Peace and Stability in Afghanistan  Preparing the Ground for Peace and ReconciliationThe Canadian Government's Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade funded the initial phase of activities from December 2009 to June 2010. This phase consisted of field research, desk research, a symposium called ""Coordinating Peace Efforts in Afghanistan"" in Kabul in February 2010, and a civil society Peace Conference titled ""A Common Voice for Peace and Reconciliation"" in April 2010. The Field research took place from January to March 2010 and involved conducting semi-structured interviews with 453 men and women from various ethnic, linguistic, and social backgrounds across 11 provinces of Afghanistan. Additionally, 130 men and women participated in 30 focus group discussions across 12 provinces. The survey and the focus groups asked participants to share their vision of an ideal Afghanistan. The results of this research informed the Peace Conference. Afghans from all over their country had similar aspirations for their future. They envision a secure, united, prosperous, progressive, democratic, and politically stable Islamic government free from corruption and discrimination. While some prioritize specific characteristics over others, these shared goals were identified by most participants. (The attached research report provides more details.)

The organization seeks to empower communities to actively participate in the defense of their rights and works to create spaces for dialogue and action that foster a culture of respect for human rights and human dignity.  VISION: To build a democratic, just, and equitable society where human rights are respected and protected, and where individuals and communities are free and autonomous to make decisions that affect their lives and surroundings.  Origins and Development  A segment of civil society in Chihuahua, known as the ""Red Ciudadana,"" had been advocating for a Citizen Participation Law since 2001. However, it wasn't until 2017, with a change in state government, that the proposal was finally presented to the Congress. During that time, a voluntary collective called Wikipolítica Chihuahua, in which we were involved, had been organizing for a year and participated in protests against the Peña Nieto government's ""Gasolinazo."" We promoted our proposal #SinVotoNoHayDinero, which aimed to link party financing to electoral votes obtained. Unfortunately, this proposal was rejected in Congress, leading us to realize that we couldn't rely on the so-called ""representatives."" We understood that real change could only be achieved through direct participation.  Paquita Jiménez, a prominent advocate for Citizen Participation in Chihuahua and director of the Red Ciudadana, invited us to those initial protests and later called on us to defend the Citizen Participation Law proposal in the State Congress. After over a decade of struggle, we finally had the opportunity to turn this proposal into reality. However, a problem emerged: a Citizen Participation Law couldn't exist without people's participation. Therefore, we needed to raise awareness about the potential that this law could bring and capture people's attention to demand our right to participate.  We needed to believe in the possibility of a new story that depended on us pressuring the lawmakers not to turn the law into an empty measure, leaving behind any pretense and ensuring that participation mechanisms were accessible to everyone. We took to the streets and used social media with the slogan #DependeDeNosotras, emphasizing that our demands should become a reality. After a year of participating in technical discussion tables, using social media to inform decision-makers, and engaging with the public through an intense campaign, we successfully defended each participation mechanism, fighting for feasible figures to encourage more people to get involved. We used every possible method, including social media, newspapers, marches, and interviews. Finally, in May 2018, the Citizen Participation Law was approved, fulfilling a social demand that created new counterbalances to prevent abuses of power and enable us to participate beyond merely voting in elections. This law also established citizen participation as a Human Right in the State Constitution. It became evident that our voices could make a significant impact.  Less than a year after the approval of the Citizen Participation Law, on February 18, 2019, we found ourselves in the need to put it into practice. In collaboration with the ""Salvemos los Cerros"" movement, we participated in the first municipal Public Hearing in the State of Chihuahua, demanding a halt to the construction of a gas station in the Cerro Grande ""Arewákawi."" Following this joint effort, we engaged in months of technical discussions, where we had to fight for every paragraph of the State and Municipal Participation Regulations through exhausting debates with the current administration's council members. That same year, we actively participated in the first Open City Council in the city's history, highlighting the importance of participation and being heard to achieve true democracy.  In 2019, on April 26, the City Council approved a project that aimed to concession and privatize the municipality's public lighting for 15 years, amounting to 6.2 billion pesos. Faced with this situation, a group of individuals came together to form the collective ""Chihuahua Decide."" We decided to activate the first binding Plebiscite in Chihuahua's history, consulting people on whether they were in favor or against the project. To achieve this, we collected over 3,424 signatures within a 90-day period. We participated as the organizing group, and Carlos served as the common representative of the plebiscite's driving group, as well as the spokesperson and communication director of the campaign opposing the project. With just one month and an exceptional volunteer team, we led the collective creation of the citizen campaign #NoQuierenLuzQuierenDinero (They Don't Want Light, They Want Money), with minimal resources that included developing a media plan, negative news coverage, an online campaign, as well as online and physical activations, and a debate with the municipality. In the end, we succeeded in having 62,032 people vote, with an overwhelming victory against the mega-project. This municipal plebiscite surpassed by 40,000 votes the Chapultepec Corridor Consultation in Mexico City and the Marcelino García Barragán Cycle Path consultation in Guadalajara, Jalisco. That was when we realized that ""the more people decide, the more we can achieve.""

Their mission also involves ensuring corporations and businesses respect human rights and their environmental responsibilities to promote social, economic, and ecological justice for these communitiesOrigins and Development  Inclusive Development International was founded in 2012 to help provide strategies and resources to individuals and groups pushing for inclusive development.They partner with organizations in Africa and Southeast Asia to fight back against “human rights abuses caused by unjust development.”Their cornerstone project, “Following the Money to Justice began in 2016 as a response to the global land-grabbing crisis.  Developmental projects facilitated by large corporations in these areas often have a way of disenfranchising, underdeveloping, and stressing vulnerable populations with very few “local benefits.” As such, IDI puts a stop to destructive developmental projects that promote human rights abuse.  These harmful projects are usually funded by organizations (multinationals, commodity traders and buyers, private equity investors, global brands) that are “bound by rules that require them to do no harm and respect human rights and to the environment” and present themselves as “responsible corporate citizens. However, the nature of this funding makes it hard for these organizations to be identified, rendering it difficult for these grassroots communities to defend their rights effectively.

The organization primarily focuses on improving women's socio-economic status and enlightening them through their involvement in different development activities. AWC is registered as a charity NGO with the Governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan. It has been running various activities for Afghan refugees in Peshawar, Pakistan, since 1986, and it has also been operating a hospital in Kabul since 1992. AWC is registered with the Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Women Affairs UNDP, UNOPS, and WFP as an Afghan NGO and with the Ministry of Justice as a social organization.  The core goals of AWC are to improve the living conditions and strengthen the health, education, and socio-economic status of women and children in Afghan society. They aim to accomplish this through their involvement in development activities, which include:  - Securing women's civil and social rights based on Islamic principles and Afghan culture and traditions.  - Creating understanding, cooperation, and harmony among Afghan women on national and international issues.  - Advancing the place of women in Afghan society.  - Encouraging and promoting education for Afghan women at the national level.  - Improving Afghan women's social, economic, health, and cultural conditions.  - Establishing friendly relations with similar organizations around the world.  - Providing opportunities for women to actively educate the next generation in the rehabilitation and development of Afghan society by building their capacity.  AWC is committed to working effectively within its mandate, mission, and objectives for Afghanistan and its people.  Origins and Development  Afghan women have always played a crucial and active role in the fight for freedom. Many brave Afghan women have fought against invaders throughout history, becoming a glorious part of the country's history. These events are unforgettable and will serve as a source of encouragement and inspiration for future generations.  Given the immense suffering that women in Afghanistan faced during the resistance against the Soviet occupation, it is necessary to ensure that they have full access to fundamental human rights. The Afghanistan Women's Council was established to advocate for better conditions for Afghan women and increase awareness of human rights, women's rights, refugee rights, children's rights, peace-building, and democracy issues within the Afghan context. It is worth mentioning that the AWC has received four international awards for its performance in these areas since its establishment in 1986.  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Fatana Ishaq Gailani is the organization's Founder and President, with over nine members serving as acting directors, managers, trainers, and advisers on the board. She is also the Human Rights Director of the organization. This organization has received funding and support from various entities, including the World Food Programme, War Child Canada, the Canadian International Agency, the Development Organization of the Czech Republic, the European Union, and the Department of International Development.

Please help us complete it.Before establishing each Women's Committee, the project team overcame the target community's unique social and economic barriers. Customs were observed to ensure community support for the action, and local communities were involved in the establishment process. Community experts were hired for the program, and they conducted sensitization workshops and awareness sessions and efficiently mobilized elders and other members of local families. Additionally, they advertised the project's activities and benefits to gain more support from the community. advertising the project's activities and benefits.Major Projects and Events  AWC has undertaken several major projects, including Basic Education, which aims to empower women in Afghanistan. As part of this effort, children are encouraged to attend school, freeing time for their mothers to take classes. The curriculum covers a range of topics such as literacy, math, health, parenting, conflict resolution, peace-building, environment, community leadership, rehabilitation, human rights, women's rights, the rule of law, transitional justice, good governance, civil society, democracy, peace development, and reconciliation. In addition, AWC specializes in Community Development, Health, Alternative Livelihood Programs, and small and medium-sized Enterprise Development. Since 1986, thousands of Afghan women have been taught and empowered through these programs.  One of the primary issues faced by women is the lack of education. Afghanistan has one of the lowest literacy rates for adult women worldwide, resulting in a lack of understanding of fundamental human rights and gender equality. This makes women feel less confident and unable to participate actively in public and private spheres.  Furthermore, traditional practices that prevent women from directly interacting with male purchasers and traders negatively impact their ability to start productive businesses. These challenges and a lack of necessary skills often leave women alone to handle household problems. Consequently, community-level issues are given lower priority than individual problems.  Healthcare: Mother and Child Health Clinic:  The Mother and Child Health Clinic commenced its services in 2000 to provide healthcare facilities to 25,000 low-income families in the Shahrak Khurasan area of Kabul. Despite the lack of support from any donor, the clinic successfully continued its operations until 2002. Eleven dedicated staff members provided their services for 10 hours daily without compensation. They visited 60-80 mothers and children daily and provided them with lab tests and proper medication.  Psychosocial Support and Counseling:  Psychological support and counselling are essential for maintaining good mental health. The AWC offered individual and group counselling sessions to promote self-esteem and self-confidence. The counselling sessions also aimed to improve interpersonal and inter-group relations. The AWC also provided support for managing stress, anger, and grief.  [i]Relief &amp; RehabilitationAWC has been actively involved in providing relief and rehabilitation services to the people of Afghanistan. Mainly, AWC has provided relief aid to 1,000 women during winter. Additionally, AWC has been supporting many more women monthly. Furthermore, AWC has completed a relief project in Paktika and Parwan Provinces. The project provided clean drinking water and necessary materials for shelter and food to 500 families. This project was initiated in 2002 and has proved to be very helpful for the communities in these provinces. In terms of rehabilitation, AWC has completed drinking water projects with the support of the local people. These projects have helped 25 families access clean drinking water by installing a deep well with a hand pump.RIGHTS, PEACE &amp; DEMOCRACYAWC has attended conferences, workshops, and seminars on human rights, peace-building, and democracy worldwide since 1993, explicitly concerning Afghan women's issues. AWC provided training courses on human rights, women's rights, peace-building, democracy, and management to Afghan women residing in Afghanistan and the Afghan Refugee environment in Peshawar, Pakistan. AWC conducted seminars and workshops to raise awareness among women regarding their rights and unite them to amplify their voices. This helps them secure their rights in society, starting from the family level and moving up to high positions in government.  The Afghan Women's Council (AWC) has played a crucial role in encouraging women to participate in the presidential and parliamentary elections, a significant step in promoting gender equality in the country. The AWC has also raised concerns about the country's violation of human and women's rights to the President and cabinet members. The council has organized several meetings with high-ranking officials to discuss national and international issues.  Moreover, the AWC has regularly reported on human rights abuses in Afghanistan and appealed to the international community, such as the United Nations, Amnesty International, and other international human rights organizations.  The AWC seeks financial and professional assistance from individuals and institutions to achieve its goals while maintaining its sovereignty and independence. The AWC is responsible to its partners and communities by providing periodic and annual progress and financial reports and regularly evaluating its activities.  AWC provided several programs to its participants, including Income Generation Training, Vocational Training, Skills Sharing Workshops, and Introduction to Micro-Finance Training. The Income Generation Training included topics such as marketing, management, small business, basic accounting, entrepreneurship, legal and gender issues. Vocational Training offered training in sewing, knitting, handicrafts, soap making, vegetable gardening, sweet and pickle making, and poultry raising. In the Skills Sharing Workshops, women shared knowledge, experiences, and lessons learned in project-related areas. The Introduction to Micro-Finance Training covered features such as an explanation of the structure and purpose of micro-finance, including loans, savings programs, and Village Organizations.Micro-Finance:AWC has provided skills training to 5,000 widows and the most vulnerable women in Benehesar, Qala e Musa, Qala e Fatullah, Deh Afghanistan, Kandahar, Parwan, and Jalalabad. These women were able to run their businesses and support their families. To further support economic stability, AWC planned to provide loans to 1,500 widows and vulnerable women in Kabul, Parwan, Kandahar, and Jalalabad. This enabled them to establish their businesses and have a sustainable source of income.  AWC organized several meetings to achieve specific goals. The meetings included:  - Home Visits: Participants and their families were met to explain the program and gain support for women's participation.  - Small Group Meetings: Women worked together as a group, guaranteeing joint loans, repayment, marketing, and supporting each other's businesses.  - Village Organization Meetings: Women formed a community to manage credit and savings and support one another in developing their small businesses.  - Micro-Finance Committee Meetings: Meetings were held for project planning, development, implementation, and monitoring related to micro-finance to ensure success.  - Steering Committee Meetings: The Steering Committee provided greater oversight, overseeing project planning, development, implementation, and monitoring.  - Working Group Meetings: The Working Group meetings included a detailed analysis of women's needs, focusing on vocational training and income generation. [ii]The Afghanistan Women's Council puts great emphasis on staff development. They train their staff on various topics such as human rights, women's and children's rights, labour rights, peace development, democracy, micro-finance, MF management, office management, women's leadership, accounting, social organization, and gender issues. To further enhance their knowledge, some staff were sent to New Delhi and Sri Lanka to participate in seminars and workshops. The council also conducted various seminars and workshops in Kabul, Parwan, Kandahar and Jalalabad to raise awareness among Afghans, especially women, and to encourage them to participate in the presidential and parliamentary elections. Additionally, AWC is recognized worldwide as a human rights defender organization, and thus, they have actively participated in most of the seminars, workshops, and meetings on such issues.

Its primary objective was to conduct comprehensive research on Afghan women's lives' political, social, economic, and cultural aspects. Over the years, Afghan women have been denied their fundamental human rights, and their rights were not acknowledged by the various governments in power. Therefore, AWC decided to establish a research center to raise awareness about this issue and study how Afghan women can effectively regain their rights while adhering to religion, Afghan culture, and traditions.  AWC is reflecting women's issues in its weekly publication, and a research magazine will be published on these topics as soon as the proposal for this project is approved. The center regularly conducts round table discussions with the active participation of women to discuss and evaluate major historical events, human rights, and women's rights. Reports of these discussions are published weekly in local media, and their appeals are passed on to the international community. [i][i]  Afghanistan Women Council. International Support. 2019.

This was in stark contrast to the harsh period of de facto Taliban rule from 1996 to 2001, when the regime was hostile towards civil society organizations, and the international community was not yet prepared to invest in this area. Despite this, there were some Afghan NGOs that actively monitored and reported on the conflict during the Taliban era and played a crucial role in exerting international pressure. However, they had limited opportunities to influence the regime.  The involvement of Afghan civil society in the Shia Law debate started when a parliamentarian alerted civil society representatives that a draft law was being considered by the Wolesi Jirga (the lower house of parliament). Several civil society organizations worked together with concerned MPs to propose specific amendments to the law that would bring it in line with international human rights standards. In addition, recommendations were also drawn from other sources of Shia jurisprudence, including renowned and highly respected religious scholars in the region. Meetings with Sunni and Shia members of parliament and other political actors were held, and the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) played a crucial role in mobilizing a broader civil society network. Up to 30 different organizations, including the Swiss-supported Civil Society and Human Rights Network, Global Rights, UNIFEM, and others, became involved in advocating against the law following the international outcry against it.  ACSF was known for its impartiality and non-partisan identity, which were its main characteristics. It believed in democratic principles of people's participation and was committed to empowering the Afghan population. Additionally, ACSF embraced the diversity of civil society stakeholders and emphasized non-partisanship, transparency, accountability, and promoting a sense of voluntarism and social activism.  The objectives of ACSF were to promote the development of civil society in Afghanistan, increase the involvement of all sectors and levels of Afghan society in the reconstruction, development, and peace process, enable civil society to have a voice on critical national issues, and strengthen the networking of civil society. [i] [1][i]  Swiss agency for Development and cooperation (SDC) (2009). Afghanistan Civil Society Forum.  https://www.eda.admin.ch/deza/en/home/themes-sdc/fragile-contexts-and-prevention.html/content/dezaprojects/SDC/en/2005/7F04159/phase3Origins and Development  The Afghan Civil Society Forum was created in 2001 to foster a partnership between Afghan civil society stakeholders and Swisspeace. This was done at the request of 76 participants of the first Afghan Civil Society Conference in Germany. The conference was held alongside a meeting of political representatives organized by the UN at Petersburg near Bonn. The goal of the conference was to involve Afghan civil society in the peace and reconstruction process using a bottom-up approach.  [i] [2] The information was based on research conducted by the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit (AREU) on the process of drafting the Shia Personal Law and the subsequent signing and revision of the law in June 2009.  Civil society in Afghanistan played a significant role in shaping new laws and advocating for the rights of the people. In one example from 2009, the Afghan parliament passed a law that applied to the country's Shia minority, requiring women to obtain their husband's permission before leaving their homes and making it illegal to refuse sexual intercourse with their husbands. This law, known as the Shia Personal Status Law or the Shia Law, was met with widespread criticism from both the international community and Afghan society. Switzerland also expressed its concern about the law. As a result, some of the most controversial provisions, such as the minimum age for marriage for girls, have already been revised, and the sections related to restrictions on movement and sexual behaviour are under reconsideration. The revision process has been facilitated by the efforts of civil society organizations, which have played a crucial role in promoting these amendments.  ACSF's success demonstrates how even small donors like Switzerland can significantly impact Afghanistan. The Board of Directors of ACSF was made up of nine national and two international members, including SDC's Country Director. Furthermore, Switzerland has gained a reputation for supporting civil society organizations, networks, and human rights in Afghanistan. SDC focused on promoting human rights-based approaches, including in the rural development sector. They also supported the establishment and functioning of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) and the Human Rights Support Unit at the Ministry of Justice to mainstream the issue within the Afghan government. In addition,Switzerland was widely recognized for its non-partisan and purely civilian engagement in civil society and human rights in Afghanistan. Aziz Rafie attests that Switzerland was considered to be one of the most non-biased states in Afghanistan. Despite the commitment of Switzerland and other countries, much work remains to be done. All stakeholders, both Afghan and international, will continue to face significant challenges for many years to come. [ii] [1]  The Advocacy section of ACSFo has set up four advocacy committees, which are as follows: the Advocacy Committee for Persons with Disabilities (ACPD), the Environment Protection Advocacy Committee (EPAC), the Afghan Youth Advocacy Committee, the Economic Literacy and Budget Analysis Group (ELBAG) in Kabul and the regional advocacy committee in Bamyan, Nangarhar, Gardez, and Balkh provinces. [iii] [2]ACSFo has recently made significant changes to its core programmatic intervention and strategy in response to the situation in Afghanistan post-August 2021. Over the last ten years, ACSFo has undertaken more than 52 programmatic interventions in this area, with five new interventions initiated in 2021.

Officail Website:  https://endwaterpoverty.org/member/afghanistan-civil-society-forum-organization/Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe Afghan Civil Society Forum (ACSF) became an independent organization in February 2002 with the help of initial funding from the Swiss and German governments. Its office in Kabul opened two months later. Initially, ACSF conducted dialogue exchanges and confidence-building forums to identify topics of relevance for the peace and reconstruction process that might have otherwise been neglected. In 2003 and 2004, ACSF focused on supporting the Bonn Agreement's implementation and conducted educational and advocacy activities for the drafting of Afghanistan's new Constitution, voter education, and events preparing for the October 2004 presidential elections. In 2005, ACSF continued to focus on elections by undertaking a massive voter education project before the September 2005 parliamentary elections. ACSF was deeply involved in the upcoming elections with the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC), bringing civil society into the discussion of the preparatory process and earmarking half a million Swiss Francs for ACSF's activities as part of its financial contribution to the international election support program.  [i]  [1][i]  Swiss agency for Development and cooperation (SDC) (2009). Afghanistan Civil Society Forum.  https://www.eda.admin.ch/deza/en/home/themes-sdc/fragile-contexts-and-prevention.html/content/dezaprojects/SDC/en/2005/7F04159/phase3Specializations, Methods and ToolsIt is evident that organizations and civil society leaders took up the issue of making the law of their own accord, without being formally invited by the Ministry of Justice or any other government actor. They became involved in the process by inserting themselves and insisting that they had valuable contributions to offer, rather than participating as formally recognized elements of civil society in law-making.  It is apparent that there were no formalized interactions between voters and their parliamentary representatives. As a result, civil society organizations must bear a significant burden. A representative from one such organization stated that there is minimal public discussion of laws, and parliamentarians are not in touch with their constituents. Thus, they rely heavily on civil society. Despite this, the example of the Shia Law illustrates how civil society has been effective in playing a watchdog role over the parliament and executive. Citizen groups, who were not accustomed to participating meaningfully in the political system at the national level, have taken on the role of concerned citizens. As per recent research, it was revealed that civil society ultimately influenced the content of the law and later succeeded in having it put under review. This was due to the impetus from the international outcry over the law and the massive international media coverage that set off condemnation from Western leaders. This kind of protest inside Afghanistan was unique and dangerous but was supported robustly by established civil society organizations. [i] [1][i]  Swiss agency for Development and cooperation (SDC) (2009). Afghanistan Civil Society Forum.  https://www.eda.admin.ch/deza/en/home/themes-sdc/fragile-contexts-and-prevention.html/content/dezaprojects/SDC/en/2005/7F04159/phase3Major Projects and Events  The ACSF, which had over 100 members and worked with more than 200 partners, had six offices scattered throughout the country before the government's collapse in 2021. The forum's primary responsibilities included coordinating various civil society organizations, providing civic education, building capacity, conducting advocacy work, and carrying out research on civil society issues.  The Afghan Civil Society Forum (ACSF) played an essential role in coordinating and integrating the various segments of Afghan civil society, which are traditionally divided along tribal, kinship, and religious lines. The ACSF represented Afghanistan's civil society organizations in international conferences such as the Donor Conference in Paris in June 2008 and the international conference in The Hague in March 2009. Additionally, ACSF's website receives 250 visitors every day, with the largest group coming from the United States, Iran, or Germany. Over the past two decades, the organization has published 42 editions of its monthly magazine, Jamea-e-Madani, which is considered one of the best magazines on civil society issues by intellectual circles. [i] [1]  In 2009, EPAC conducted seven regular advocacy committee meetings and four other meetings to address environmental concerns such as air, earth, and water pollution, and more specifically, contamination of underground water and its solutions. Furthermore, EPAC members prepared a report on ""usage of underground water and absorbing wells"", and were provided with the national environment protection law. Finally, a resolution was developed by the committee to control air pollution, which was subsequently sent to the media.  The members of ELBAG conducted ten advocacy meetings focusing on issues related to accountability and transparency, and they also prepared a report on the agricultural sector and its further development in the country. They collaborated with OSI's informal initiative for EITI advocacy to promote transparency and accountability. This joint effort would continue to support civil society and ACSFo's advocacy programs.  ACSFo's advocacy section was involved in several workshops and conferences in addition to their thematic working areas. Here are some highlights:ACSFo was responsible for the expenditure of invitation cards, their distribution, and the development of mottos for the Women's International Day celebration on March 8th in the Loya Jirga tent. This event was held in cooperation with AIHRC and other civil society organizations.  ACSFo arranged two preparatory meetings with the media, journalist unions, and representatives of CSOs to hold a press conference. The invitation letter was published in three daily newspapers: the 8 am, Arman and Wisa. The press conference was held on September 16th in ACSFo to discuss the martyrdom of Sultan Ahmad Munadi and other journalists killed during the year 2009. The press statement included precise and logical wills from the government of Afghanistan and the British embassy. The conference was attended by a large number of civil society activists, media representatives, and journalists and was broadly broadcast by mass media.  ACSFo also held a press conference on October 7th to discuss the decline of women's seats in provincial councils. This event was attended by a large number of women activists, and the messages of the conference were widely broadcast by the media.  On October 14th, the third conference on the status of presidential and provincial councils' elections was held in ACSFo. The conference was organized by ACSFo and representatives of civil society organizations. Its main focus was on ensuring transparency in the elections and adherence to the constitution and other laws. The conference was widely broadcasted by the media.

Annual Narrative Report To SDC.  http://acsf.af/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ACSFo-Annual-Report-2009-.pdfAnalysis and Lessons Learned  Advocacy is a relatively new topic in Afghanistan, and many people lack knowledge and skills in this area. Most people do not understand the concept of advocacy, its role and importance, and how advocates can play an active role in creating, amending, and applying policies, laws, and strategies.  The Advocacy Committee for Persons with Disability, Afghan Youths Advocacy Committee, and Environment Protection Advocacy Committee have been busy with advocacy activities, lobbying, and campaigns. These committees have achieved a lot through the use of advocacy tools, such as contributing to the drafting, amending, and changing of laws and policies, such as the Elimination of Violence against Women (EVAW) Law, Environment Protection Law, National Disability Law, Media Law, and Mines Law.  However, a more systematic approach to advocacy was needed to make these activities more effective. This required knowledge, skills, and methodology in advocacy, using practical tools, and making coalitions.  Advocacy activities and initiatives faced many challenges in society, especially in post-conflict countries like Afghanistan. One of the biggest challenges for advocacy activities in Afghanistan was the lack of security. In 2009, the advocacy section experienced many security challenges that prohibited advocacy activities, such as campaigns, conferences, meetings, and workshops. Another significant challenge was the lack of knowledge and awareness among people on the concept of advocacy, advocacy methodology, and its role and importance, which further deprived people of their rights and hindered their participation in advocacy campaigns and activities.  The lack of participation and activeness of members of the Environment Protection Advocacy Committee and Afghan Youths Advocacy Committee in meetings and other advocacy events due to their engagement in their offices was also notable. The employment fluctuation and the appointment of new staff caused a gap in the activities of the advocacy section in 2009, which was another challenge. The delay in the follow-up of the approval of the National Disability Law due to presidential and provincial councils' elections and the engagement of some members of parliament in election campaigns was the other challenge during this reporting period. [i] [2]  In Afghanistan, community shuras (which were councils of elders and leaders) and tribal and religious institutions had traditionally represented their communities to the authorities. However, the modern version of the country's civil society had only recently come into existence. Bridging the gap between the modern and traditional forms of civil society has been a major challenge for Afghanistan, as the elders and tribal or religious leaders have been the most influential people in Afghan society. This has resulted in a controversy regarding the link between traditional and modern civil society. Traditional values and practices have been shaped over several centuries and were dominated by traditional, customary, tribal, ethnic, and linguistic mindsets, which were not subject to change or revision. On the other hand, modern values were more logical and subject to discourse, debate, change, and development, as Aziz Rafie explains. However, there was little dialogue between civil society and the clergy who oversee omnipresent religious traditions. [ii] [1][i]  [i] Afghanistan Civil Society Forum-organization (ACSFo) (2009).

Policy and Procedures Manual.  https://aicsafg.org/Origins and Development  The idea of establishing the Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society (AICS) has been evolving for several years within the country's civil society community. In 2007, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Aga Khan Development Network, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program, and the Asia Development Bank organized the Enabling Environment Conference to discuss ways to create a favourable environment for such an institute.  One of the main recommendations made at the conference was to establish independent certification bodies for civil society organizations that the Government would recognize, the private sector, donor agencies, and civil society. In 2010, a working group comprising donors, civil society networks, and INGOs was created. The working group developed the vision, mission, and strategic objectives of the Afghanistan Independent Civil Society Organization (AICS). AICS was established by the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) in partnership with Counterpart International under the USAID-funded Afghanistan Civic Engagement Program (ACEP) in 2014. The long-term goal of AICS was to enable CSOs to realize their potential in support of the development of Afghanistan. This initiative was backed by crucial CSO networks, civil society professionals, and representatives from national and international CSOs who have an interest in Afghanistan. [i] [1][i]  Afghanistan Institute For Civil Society (AICS) official website page:  https://aicsafg.org/Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society (AICS) became an NGO registered with the Ministry of Economy (MoEc) in 2014 and was officially launched in February 2015. Its long-term goal was to support civil society in Afghanistan and help it realize its potential to contribute to the development of the country. The organization's third Executive Director played a critical role in ensuring its programmatic and organizational success. Being unique and essential to Afghanistan's civil society, the AICS required a competent leader to steer it towards success.  [i] [5]In additions, The establishment of the AICS is being supported by the USAID funding. [ii] [1][i]  Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society. Official Website page:  https://easyjoob.com/companies/afghanistan-institute-for-civil-society-aics/[ii]  Afghanistan Institute For Civil Society (AICS) official website page:  https://aicsafg.org/   Specializations, Methods and Tools  AICS has made significant contributions to enhancing education in Afghanistan through its multifaceted approach. This approach includes digital learning, capacity building, policy influence, and collaboration. AICS has expertise in conducting thorough assessments of community education, identifying gaps, and understanding specific requirements. It facilitates collaboration with local stakeholders and engages with leaders, teachers, parents, and community members. This builds partnerships and empowers Shuras to manage schools effectively. Furthermore, AICS has the proven expertise to design a flexible and relevant curriculum that addresses the unique needs and challenges of community-based education (CBE), especially alternative learning classes (ALC). AICS can provide comprehensive training to teachers on CBE, driven by years of community-level expertise and contextual needs. Monitoring and evaluation are vital elements in achieving substantial progress, and AICS has relied on this to enhance the capacity of numerous grassroots organizations relevant to education. In addition, AICS has the expertise to lay out mechanisms adaptable to the CBE needs to evaluate the local shura contribution and the entire unplaced system's competency and applicability to achieve the intended progress. With the objective of conducting CBS and ALC classes successfully in Afghanistan, AICS has the potential to make a significant impact.  After assessing various CSOs under its Certification program and analyzing key findings, AICS found that many CSOs require assistance in developing policies for different organizational functions. To help address this need, AICS has created a set of generic policy reference manuals for essential management functions that can be adapted to an organization's internal culture, values, context, and structure. These policy reference manuals/guidebooks have been developed with the aim of strengthening the management of CSOs. [i] [1][i]  Afghanistan Institute For Civil Society (AICS) official website page:  https://aicsafg.org/Major Projects and Events  These are the core activities of AICS:  The AICS Certification Program was designed to enhance the effectiveness and credibility of the civil society sector by certifying CSOs against recognized standards, both locally and internationally. From an organizational perspective, civil society is defined as the voluntary association of people in a society. The certification program empowers CSOs to align their policies, processes, structure, programs, and activities with the best international practices, thereby contributing to the growth of a competent, transparent, and effective civil society in Afghanistan.  AICS had the knowledge and skills to significantly contribute to reducing the education gap in Afghanistan, especially in women's education. They established a strong network with NGOs/CSOs nationwide through initiatives such as National Civil Society Week (NCSW) and (SEECA). The DCOP provided e-learning courses and peer-to-peer learning facilities that empower individuals and organizations to develop and refine their skills and knowledge, enabling them to tackle the unique challenges faced in Afghanistan. This created a strong community of sharing and collaboration, increasing the effectiveness and impact of their work. Their innovative approach to blended learning in civil society, which combines in-person training, workshops, and mentorship sessions with impactful e-learning content, has made a lasting impression on member organizations and the overall civic space. With the guidance of Education Advisors, AICS was well-positioned to play a critical role in advancing Afghanistan's National Education system towards sustainability and resilience.  AICS improved the relevance and effectiveness of capacity-building services for Afghan CSOs by coordinating and harmonizing initiatives. Moreover, AICS organized two cross-learning events to assist CSOs interested in applying for certification. The objectives of the events were to foster discussions, exchange ideas, enhance the organizational performance of CSOs, and promote the work of certified CSOs. During the first event, ten representatives of certified and non-certified CSOs from Takhar, Nangarhar, Herat, Paktia, and Kabul provinces discussed the benefits and merits of the certification program. In the second event, AICS-certified CSOs presented and discussed human resources, governance, strategic planning, communications and outreach, and financial management benchmarks. In total, 19 CSOs benefited from these events.  The Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society conducted quarterly Information Sessions for representatives of donors, INGOs and CSOs. These sessions aimed to increase CSOs' access to efficient, quality and relevant capacity-building services. During the sessions, stakeholders discussed the persistent gaps and strengths of CSOs that were assessed through AICS' certification program. This allowed stakeholders to interact, understand and suggest ways forward to strengthen CSOs' capacity in areas such as governance, project management, financial management, communication, and human resource management.  Policy Engagement and Research:AICS Policy Engagement and Research aimed to influence policies, monitor government accountability, and advocate for reforms through effective initiatives. This unit conducted civil society thematic roundtables in provinces and issued policy briefs on relevant civil society issues in Afghanistan.  State of the Enabling Environment for Civil Society in Afghanistan (SEECA):Civil society organizations (CSOs) played a crucial role in development. They complement the efforts of the government, private sector, and donors. AICS recognizes that the enabling environment plays a crucial role in promoting or hindering the effectiveness of civil society. Therefore, AICS has conducted its annual flagship research on the State of the Enabling Environment for CSOs in Afghanistan (SEECA) since 2016. The research examined the legal framework, governance, socio-cultural environment, and financial and security environments in which CSOs operate. It was the responsibility of all actors, including the government, private sector, CSOs, international community, and donors, to enhance the CSO enabling environment. The study provides recommendations based on the research findings, either directly suggested by respondents or corresponding to the challenges CSOs are facing in Afghanistan. AICS has conducted SEECA research in 2016, 2017, and 2018.  Roundtables: AICS organized several thematic roundtables in Kabul, Herat, Kandahar, Balkh, Nangarhar, and Bamyan after its establishment. The objective of these roundtables was to bring together civil society activists, media representatives, university lecturers, government officials, and think tank scholars to share their thoughts and ideas regarding the relevant discussions. Regional Collaboration:Innovation for Change was a growing global network of people and online hubs. The network has regional hubs in Africa, Central Asia, East Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, South Asia, and the Pacific. These hubs serve as a meeting point for individuals and organizations to connect, exchange ideas, and collaborate to find solutions to today's and tomorrow's challenges.  The South Asia Hub of Innovation for Change provides an inclusive and secure space to design ideas for creating an enabling environment for civil society. This was especially relevant in areas where government restrictions impede the ability of civil society organizations to work together and achieve their goals. The Afghanistan Institute for Civil Society hosted the Secretariat of the Innovation for Change South Asia Hub. It coordinated events and activities in the South Asia region to promote the exchange of ideas and foster collaboration amongst organizations. [i] [1][i]  Afghanistan Institute For Civil Society (AICS) official website page:  https://aicsafg.org/Analysis and Lessons Learned  In 2019, AICS assessed a total of 34 civil society organizations (CSOs) in Afghanistan, which included 11 large and medium-sized CSOs, as well as 23 grassroots CSOs. In total, 107 CSOs have been assessed so far, and out of these, 57 have successfully obtained the minimum score required for certification and have been conferred with an AICS certificate. In 2019, 15 CSOs were certified, out of which nine were medium-large, and six were grassroots organizations. However, the remaining 19 CSOs were deferred as they were unable to achieve the minimum score required for certification. AICS identified the areas of improvement for these deferred CSOs and hoped to reassess them once they address these gaps during the deferral period.

Afghanistan has one of the lowest literacy proficiency rates in the world, with over 12 million adults being illiterate. Although formal education has gradually improved, the literacy rate among adults remains at 34.8%, with vulnerable groups especially excluded. Only 24% of women are literate compared to 52% of men. As a result, 4.2 million learners in the priority group (aged 15-35) urgently need youth and adult literacy and primary education, including pre-vocational skills training. These vulnerabilities have been further exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19 and the political transition that took place in August 2021.  ACDO has partnered with AABRAR Support to improve education in Laghman province, Afghanistan's Dawlatshah, Alishang, and Alingar districts. The main goal is to provide education to 3710 boys and girls, with an emphasis on promoting education and gender equality by enrolling 73% of girls. The project involves the establishment of 106 learning centers and the recruitment of 111 qualified teachers. These teachers underwent a 14-day training program that covered topics such as core pedagogy, classroom management, child safeguarding, child protection, psychosocial support (PSS), social and emotional learning (SEL), protection against exploitation and abuse (PSEA), inclusive education. They were also trained in child-centred protective and interactive methodologies, the characteristics of a good teacher and their responsibilities, different teaching methods, types of plans, lessons, and supporting materials, and classroom management.  The project also includes the establishment of 48 School Management Councils (Shuras) (SMC) and training and coordination meetings with relevant stakeholders. Additionally, minor rehabilitation of 106 classes will be carried out as part of this initiative. This partnership is a strategic move towards advancing education in the region and ensuring a brighter future for the children of Afghanistan. Moreover, The project will positively impact 3,710 girls and boys, 111 teachers, 15 staff members directly and an estimated 26,432 people indirectly. Its main aim is to increase literacy rates, create awareness about the importance of education, and contribute to the development of more robust and informed communities. The direct beneficiaries will have access to quality education and the necessary resources to excel in their studies, while the project will provide a stable source of income to more than 120 people, with an average of seven members of families. UNICEF is providing financial support for this initiative, and ACDO is receiving regular guidance and instruction from them to ensure its successful implementation. [i]  [4]Basic General Literacy Program - BGL : The Basic General Literacy (BGL) project began in October 2022 and will conclude in October 2023. The Asia Community Development Organization (ACDO) is responsible for implementing the project to provide quality education to youth and adult individuals in need. Beneficiaries of the project will receive learning materials, including classroom and student hygiene kits, winterization supplies, and learning kits for students. In addition, teachers will receive training aligned with BGL standards, policies, and Literacy Cluster requirements to ensure their capacity to provide inclusive and gender-sensitive education. [ii]  [2]  In addition, ACDO has undertaken several notable projects, including the ""Providing Emergency Assistance and Community-based Education (PEACE) project"" in Takhar province. This project has profoundly impacted the community by providing educational opportunities to 3,000 girls and boys, thereby increasing literacy rates. It has brought about a brighter future for the children and families in the target area, and its positive ripple effect will be felt for generations to come.  ACDO is currently implementing the Basic General Literacy Program, funded by UNESCO, in three provinces of Afghanistan - Samangan, Parwan, and Paktika. The program aims to establish 267 BGL classes in a total of 16 districts in these provinces, catering to 4000 youth and adults over the age of 15 years old. The program is community-based, with a focus on maximizing community outreach and responsiveness. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve adult literacy rates from 34.8% to at least 40%, especially among women and girls, thereby supporting SDG 4.6 targets. Through this intervention, ACDO aims to increase the quality, equity, and inclusiveness of education and literacy opportunities for Afghan youth and adults.Humanitarian and Emergency Response:  To effectively and transparently provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable people in Afghanistan through long-term interventions.Development and long-term interventions:  To effectively assist vulnerable populations in Afghanistan by creating sustainable, self-sufficient communities with ample opportunities for social engagement, recreation, and a high standard of living.

The organization has established an internship program to enhance the capacity of its employees and new graduates. In 2022, ACDO provided soft skills training for 11 interns. Additionally, the organization has trained and skilled more than 450 community and school shura members in dealing with their children and community members.  In addition, all project activities proceeded smoothly without significant challenges, except for the ban on women. ACDO firmly believes that transparent, safe, impartial, and non-discriminatory humanitarian and development aid is only possible with the participation of women in national and international NGOs. Women's full involvement in all aspects of aid delivery is a principled response and essential for operational effectiveness. The ban on women will have devastating consequences for men, boys, women, and girls in Afghanistan. ACDO, along with all other I/NGOs, demands the immediate and complete revocation of this order. If the ban is not lifted, it will have a catastrophic impact on the provision of assistance to millions of Afghans in urgent need of support, and it will contribute to an increase in the number of people in need.

They aim to provide advocacy, training, psycho-social support, legal assistance, and sheltering services. POWA is also involved in law and policy reform, research, campaigning, and regional and international strategic engagement [1] . Through its aims, it redefines its mission by improving the quality of life for all women and girls and cultivating a society that is secure and egalitarian, one that is intolerant of any violence against women and girls, a culture in which women and girls are treated with respect and dignity, and in which their rights are advanced [2] .  Origins and Development  POWA, founded in the Gauteng Province in 1979by a committed group of female volunteers, arose in response to the pressing necessity for an organisation capable of furnishing sanctuary and essential services to women who were victims of domestic violence [3] . POWA evolved in tandem with the nation's substantial political and social changes. Operating for 44 years, they have expanded their focus to encompass the promotion of social transformation, education, policy reforms, and women's empowerment.  [4]  This analysis pertains to the transition of South Africa from the Apartheid regime to a democratic one, where it considers how POWA aligned its objectives with the principles of democracy.  Further, POWA was the first organisation to establish a shelter for abused women in 1981 and pioneered second-stage (or transitional) housing for women in 2009 in Gauteng [5] . POWA built the capacity of emerging organisations in all nine provinces, leading to better access for women from rural and under-resourced areas. They have ensured more significant access to justice and legal services for women. They have achieved awards ‘Jozi Award Community Development (2015)’, ‘Gauteng Department of Social Development MEC Mazibuko:Gauteng Care Givers (2015)', and ‘In recognition of women for making a difference by contributing positively towards moving Gauteng City Region Forward Human Rights &amp; Democracy: Gender Equality Award Organisational category (2004) [6] . Further, POWA has contributed to the law–making process around the Domestic Violence Act and the Sexual Offences Act, monitoring the implementation of these laws [7] . POWA’s legal manager at the time, Wendy Isaack, also commented on the review ofState Institutions Supporting Constitutional Democracy, where she conducted critical findings along with recommendations and sent it to Prof. A. K Asmal, the chairperson of the study [8] . Through the provision of comments and the presentation of significant conclusions together with suggestions, she actively participated in the deliberative process, assuring the inclusion of civil society opinions and insights in the review. Finally, POWA ensured women's economic independence by providing skills development and income generation infrastructure [9] . Today, POWA has six branches throughout the province, providing education, counselling, legal services, and shelter. They also have two communal shelters and one second-stage housing as an alternative place of safety [10] . Finally, POWA actively advocates to ensure the realisation of women’s rights, ultimately improving women’s quality of life [11] .Organisational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Considering the organisational structure, POWA is a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) [12] , and as an NGO, it acts independently of government entities. POWA follows a pyramid organisational structure, with 11 members on the board to ensure the smooth sailing of the organisation. The committee comprises a Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson, Treasurer, Director, Executive Director and six other members [13] . That being said, the organisational structure would mean little if there was no membership aspect since membership promotes collaboration, awareness, and the talents and networks of committed NGO supporters, helping many organisations achieve their aims and develop a robust and supportive community. Hence, POWA’s membership and volunteer network is not limited to its staff or victims and is open to anyone who supports the cause, as this will allow for a more significant impact.  Finally, as an NGO, POWA relies heavily on funding.Funding provides resources to finance a need, program, or project (Cambridge Dictionary) [14] . While this is usually in the form of money, it can also take the form of effort or time from an organisation or company, known as in-kind funding [15] . POWA received funding in both the abovementioned ways, monetary and in-kind donations. To begin, there was a 1.6bl government grant established last year to combat gender-based violence; however, POWA, as one of the civil society organisations, has yet to receive any money from that grant [16] . This did not, however, take away from the fact that POWA has received immense support, considering its vast number of partners and collaborations, donors, and volunteers.Partners and Collaborations :  First,  House of Busby , On April 27, 2016, Guess Jeans were sold at a 10% discount in support of violence against women. POWA received the10% sales proceedsto help survivors and their children residing at POWA’s places of safety. Women and girls were asked to contribute their Guess jeans to the charity. POWA received 254 pairs of jeans on May 27, 2016, where the jeans were distributed to shelter survivors and other jeans were sold to workers and the general public to raise revenue for the shelter. To date, the proceeds from the sales total R 5 290.00 (POWA, n.d) [17] .  Next is  iLearn , which played a vital part in empowering 20 survivors by giving online computer training classes for a year [18] .  Then,  L'Oréal,  where POWA was awarded a trial collaboration initiative in 2016 by L'Oréal Professional African Salon Institute, in which five survivors received scholarships to study Hair Care for eight months [19] .The course was R50000 for each woman, which included tuition and equipment.The women werealso given R1000 in transportation each month [20] .Many survivors, particularly those housed in POWA shelters, are untrained and unemployed.Another element that keeps women in abusive relationships is financial dependency on the abusive partner. The initiative is a significant step towards empowering survivors to end the cycle of violence.The L'Oréal coursepromises women employment placements and the opportunity to create hair care enterprises. The project also allows survivors to coach others who will enter the programme after the initial group finishes the course. [ 21] A more recent contribution was a campaign launched by L’Oréal Paris, whichcollaborated with 12 female social media influencers. These influencers contributed their perspectives and opinions to the collective effort aimed at addressing and combating the prevalent issue of gender-based violence in South Africa [22] . The female individuals further endorse the L’Oréal Paris Rouge Signature EmpoweRED lipstick collection and L’Oréal Paris Revitalift Red Cream since a percentage of the proceeds generated in August will support POWA.  Then,  Joe Public Johannesburg  uses innovative newspaper advertising to raise awareness about the frequency of domestic abuse in South Africa as well as the works of POWA. “POWA TAKES OVER TV NEWS TO BREAK THE SILENCE AROUND GBV [23] ” and “THE NEWS YOU NEED TO SEE [24] ” are only two of the articles posted on Joe Public where the works of POWA are shared and the voices of victims are heard.  Finally, POWA partnered with the  Mzansi Women's Film Festival  to screen the moving film ""Alison"" at Constitutional Hill, presenting stories of perseverance and hope [25] .DonorsAs per POWA’s website, they have 13 donors, namelyMary Oppenheimer and Daughters Foundation, Suzan Stehlik Charitable Trust fund SA, Werksmans attorneys, Oxfam SA, Legal&amp;Tax, Social Development Funds, Eskom, Avon, Absa, Cliffe, Dekker Hofmeyr, Comic Relief, Wiphold, Lottery andAvon Justine and if that weren’t enough they too have a tab on their website where volunteers can donate to the cause [ 26].VolunteersPOWA’s website has a donation tab where anyone who wants to support the cause may donate. They also have barcodes that can be scanned, namely, SnapScan and Zapper, through which anyone can contribute.Specialisations, Methods and Tools  POWA covers a range of specialised domains, each of which is committed to resolving the issue of gender-based violence. The specialisations are aligned with thedepartments established within POWA's organisational structure. The Clinical Departmentfocuses on providing specialised clinical services. Qualified social workers and social auxiliary workers oversee this department's various programmes and activities. The legal and advocacy section focuses on providing technical legal advice and engaging in advocacy efforts.POWA offers direct legal assistance to those who have experienced sexual assault and intimate partner abuse. This assistance includes court support and preparations for legal proceedings. Over time, trained volunteershave provided aid to several individuals who have experienced domestic abuse. This assistance has encompassed various aspects, including facilitating the process of obtaining Protection Orders per the Domestic Abuse Act 116 of 1998 and educating women about their entitlements and available legal remedies [27] . In addition, POWA provides educational rights to many entities, including schools, communities, the South African Police Services (SAPS), the Ekurhuleni Metro Police, and other institutions about legislation such as the Domestic Violence Act, Customary Marriage Act, Sexual Violence Act, and the Domestic Partnership Act [28] . Furthermore, POWA's legal services branch actively establishes networks and cultivatesalliances. The research training and development department focuses on specialised initiatives to facilitate women's advancement, explicitly focusing on enhancing their empowerment and knowledge. Significant projects and events exemplify these endeavours.  The specialisations above are discerned by considering POWA's methodologies and tools, as they believe there is no singular pathway to effect change. Consequently, they consistently strive to explore novel and innovative techniques within their programming endeavours to attain the desired transformation. The approaches and instruments that closely correspond to participatory democracy encompass lobbying, outreach and media assistance, training and development, and feminist research and knowledge generation.Major Projects and Events  POWA takes a holistic strategy to address gender-based violence through a few significant projects. (1) RaisingHer Voice: Despite recent advancements in women's political leadership in South Africa, there is a persistent and escalating prevalence of violence against women [29] . The adverse effects of HIV and AIDS, as well as poverty, on women are significantly disproportionate [30] . By integrating grassroots awareness-raising and action with lobbying and advocacy efforts at both national and regional levels, the Raising Her Voice initiative contributes to transforming societal attitudes and behaviours. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in holding the government accountable for its pledge to adopt and enforce the African Women's Rights Protocol [31] .(2) Teenz Alliance: with this initiative,POWA engages with ADAPT  [1]  to combat sexual assault in South African schools. By offering leadership training, advocacy campaigns, and access tosexual violence treatment, this project empowers both boys and girls. POWA actively interacts with young generations to confront this severe subject by addressing sexual assault in schools and fostering a sense of equality and respect amongst students [32] . (3) Add Your Voice to #EndDomesticSilence: POWA created thiscampaign in collaboration with JOKO  [2]  to shatter the quiet around domestic abuse in South Africa. This project urges South Africans to raise their voices to support critical measures combating gender-based violence [33] . The campaign increases awareness, eliminates the stigma associated with survivors, and calls attention to the essential need to prevent domestic violence by elevating victim tales and creating discussions [34] .  Through these projects and events, POWA aims to focus on capacity-building and training regarding empowering individuals with the knowledge and skills to address violence against women. By providing training opportunities, POWA actively involves community members becoming advocates, leaders, and service providers. This aligns with the democratic principle of informed and engaged citizens driving positive change. Overall, POWA's projects also actively involve citizens, survivors, and communities in addressing gender-based violence, fostering dialogue, and advocating for policy changes. These projects recognise that meaningful change occurs when individuals and communities actively engage in the decision-making processes and advocate for their rights and the rights of others.[1]  ADAPT is a non-profit organisation that was founded in 1994 to provide therapy and support services to abused women, men, children, and older people in South Africa.[2]  JOKO is a South African tea company known for its social mission to combat domestic violence by leveraging the power of conversations and promoting awareness and support for survivors of abuse.Analysis and Lessons LearnedThe survivor-centred approach is a theoretical framework and operational methodology that places utmost importance on addressing the needs, perspectives, and agency of those who have endured traumatic or detrimental circumstances, such as instances of gender-based violence or abuse. That being said, the innovative study conducted by Goodman and Epstein focuses on the survivor-centred approach, which represents a paradigm shift in the understanding and treatment of domestic violence. The survivor-centred method is applied through confidentiality, safety, respect, and non-discrimination. The hypothesis proposed by the authors extends beyond conventional paradigms and acknowledges the resilience and agency exhibited by individuals who have experienced adversity [35] . At the core of their methodology is the notion that individuals who have experienced trauma should have an active role in their journey towards healing and restoration. The authors emphasise the critical significance of actively engaging in attentive listening to the perspectives of women who have experienced domestic violence, comprehended their distinct encounters, and enabled them to exercise agency in making choices that promote their overall welfare [36] . The work conducted by Goodman and Epstein carries significant implications for the domains of advocacy, mental health care, and the endeavour to achieve justice for survivors. The phenomenon has generated a substantial change in perspective, leading to a greater emphasis on empathy and efficacy in addressing domestic violence. This shift recognises the resilience and expertise of survivors, so promoting a survivor-centred approach in this vital domain of societal interest.  The adoption of a survivor-centred strategy by POWA not only demonstrates its effectiveness but also represents a pioneering effort in advancing participatory democracy in the realm of combating gender-based violence. Through the use of strategies aimed at empowering survivors, such as affording them a platform to express their experiences, as well as actively incorporating them in the formulation of the organisation's programmes, POWA has successfully encouraged citizen involvement and enhanced the representation of those impacted by acts of violence. This strategy is by the tenets of participatory democracy, which advocates for the active participation of citizens in making decisions that directly influence their lives. POWA has effectively established an inclusive atmosphere wherein survivors, in conjunction with community members and activists, assume a crucial role in the discourse around gender-based violence, therefore fostering democratic engagement and amplifying the voices of marginalised persons. However, the ongoing prevalence of gender-based violence in South Africa highlights the intricate nature of the problem. Despite the significant progress made by POWA, the ultimate achievement of their objectives relies on the entire elimination of violence targeting women and girls. Hence, POWA serves as both a triumph narrative and a representation of the continuous endeavour to establish a community that rejects such acts of violence that are founded upon principles of participatory democracy and the empowerment of survivors.

However, the organization addresses a wide range of issues in poor communities looking to innovate and advance the development of these areas through meaningful interaction with the affected communities and other involved stakeholders.",0,2023-10-30,2023-10-30,4062406,"""2023-10-29 21:28:43""",https://participedia.net/user/4062406,4062406,"""2023-10-30 21:05:04""",https://participedia.net/user/4062406,en,,,Cape Town,Western Cape,,South Africa,-34.0378253,18.6798895,non_profit_non_gov,,,,collaborative, community, direct,facilitate, legislation, inform,sustainable, public_participation, youth_issues,law, planning, health,," Mission and Purpose  The VPUU through its programs it regards social cohesion and social capital as significantly central to its approach.[1] This means that their programs promote solidarity and positive working relationship between citizens of the affected areas, the local government, the community-based organizations, and other bodies interested in the partnership for the development of the poor communities. The aim of the organization is to facilitate equal participation in the development of poor communities without being affiliated to political party patronage. 1  The VPUU shows no indication of any political affiliation, but outside influence cannot be totally ruled out as those might come through the funders or any bodies of power within the partnerships. Due to solidarity of the stakeholders and positive working relationship developed, ''the VPUU political approach allows it to achieve community trust in circumstances of high political contestation and anger of the communities the government for the lack of service delivery pervasive in Khayelitsha''. 1  Their strategic approach is crucial because it encompasses diverse and different bodies operating at different levels from local to international, and they include citizens in their decision-making and that to some extent is appealing to citizens as compared to how the government tends to operate.    Further, the intent and goal of the VPUU programs is to achieve a demonstrable and sustainable increase in the safety of the residential population. [2]Its programs are mandated to make significant evident changes and improvements in these communities and those are designed and implemented with the goal of longevity and reliable adequacy of standards. 3  However, outcomes of the interventions do not guarantee with certainty the quality and longevity of the results from the projects but to an extent it guarantees there will most likely be interventions taking place in affected communities or areas of focus. In addition, the VPUU projects are not state driven as they advocate for citizens to be at the center of the programs and mobilizing community-based groups to monitor and ensure that the community actively participate in securing their rights. 2[1]  Barolsky, V.

Survey Methodology in Violence-prone Khayelitsha, Cape Town, South Africa. IDS Bulletin. Vol. 40. No, 3. Blackwell Publishing Ltd.Origins and Development  In the South African democratic state, townships have been suffering great social, economic, and cultural issues but more prominently unemployment, poor infrastructure, high crime rate to name few. This led to the VPUU founders identifying the gap and saw the need to create safer and sustainable communities as a proactive response to the high levels of direct violence and crime in Cape Town. 3  The project of the VPUU was established around 2005 in Harare Khayelitsha and the main areas of focus at the start of the project was Harare, Site C and Kuyasa respectively. 2  To provide context of Khayelitsha, it is a large township with predominantly informal settlements located approximately 30 kilometers south-east of Cape Town, and was formed in 1983 as primarily formal settlements that was meant to accommodate the overcrowding in Crossroad, Nyanga, Langa, and Gugulethu which are also large townships of Cape Town. 4  The township of Khayelitsha is well known to be crime ridden and poor to non-existent road infrastructure and other social services, 5  and all these challenges in Khayelitsha motivated the establishment of the VPUU programs to work with communities to encounter the challenges they face daily.  Therefore, the establishment of the VPUU was made possible by a range of different stakeholders which includes the City of Cape Town, the German Development Bank, the Khayelitsha Community, the SAPS, ward councilors, ward committees, approximately 28 non-government organizations, Western Cape Government, the Khayelitsha Development Forum, the National Treasury, the University of the Western Cape, University of Cape Town, the Legal Aid Clinic of the Western Cape, and many other interested stakeholders. 2  The validity of these stakeholders is given by the notion that some of these stakeholders are mentioned by the VPUU websites, even though the totality of the stakeholders involved is not clearly given. Moreover, the partners or stakeholders of the VPUU further established the VPUU Not for Profit Company (VPUU NPC) which was to oversee the running of the programs and facilitate better communications and interventions between the stakeholders. 3Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  The success of the programs or events and operations of the VPUU is dependent on the efficiency of the working relationships formed and it is also attributed to the various partnerships between the stakeholders. In conducting the operations of the programs, the VPUU engage with citizen leadership and stakeholders in meetings with citizens taking partial control of the operations and the VPUU playing a supporting role along with other partners. 1  This is supported by Cloete (2012) who argues that the VPUU has a program of gathering different stakeholders of different levels and engage them regarding community development and discuss what is best for the community in negotiated development. 2  The VPUU programs are mostly ongoing projects which can be regarded as processes that progresses the needs of the communities and improve the services they receive.  The VPUU conducts its programs under different and nine areas of expertise, with six of these considered as content specific and they include the Area Based Management (ABM), Co-Design for Spatial Justice (CDSJ), Early Childhood Development for All (ECD4ALL), Local Economic Development for All (LED Broker), Information and Communications Technology for Development (ICT4D), and the Training and Development (T&amp;D).[3] The other three areas of expertise are more of processes, they are crosscutting in their operations, and these include Community Participation (CP), Project Management (PM), Monitoring (MEL). There is also within the VPUU, the Executive Support Services, which includes Office Management, Information Technology, Human Resources, and Finance &amp; Marketing departments that complete the areas of operation in the VPUU. 3Moreover, the VPUU programs and operations are co-funded by the Federal German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, the City of Cape Town, National Treasury, and together with other public and third-party funding. [3]Barolsky (2016) argues that the initial financial agreement between the German Development Bank and the City of Cape Town stipulated that a project-implementing agent or intermediary known as the VPUU Consortium should implement the intervention led by a team of consultants from Sun Development Pty Ltd, which is a subsidiary of a company heard-quartered in German. 1[3]  http://vpuu.ac.za1  Barolsky, V. (2016). Is social cohesion relevant to a city in the global south? A case of Khayelitsha township.6  Okurut, K. Kulabako, R. N. Chenoweth, J. &amp; Charles, K. (2015). Assessing demand for improved sustainable sanitation in low-income informal settlements of urban areas: a critical review. International Journal of Environmental Health.Specializations, Methods and Tools  The VPUU typically initiates and look to address the issues affecting citizens by seeking their involvement in the projects, and the community can also initiate the area it would like the VPUU to assist in addressing. 3  This, therefore, means that any stakeholder can initiate the programs and seek inputs and support of the other stakeholders, and the VPUU in some cases provides training workshops if the program requires citizens to have the skill sets for a particular program. Barolsky (2016) argues that one of the key citizen engagement tools that the VPUU uses is baseline surveys, which the organization discursively constructs as giving a voice to ordinary citizens through a random sample. 1Major Projects and Events  The challenges of poor service delivery in townships of Cape Town with its fast-growing informal settlements is a challenge the local government is struggling to maintain. The event in this work will focus on the challenges of poor sanitation and the inadequate service delivery in informal settlements of Khayelitsha. The event or project studied in this work is the City Spec Mobile Inspection Tool for Improving Service Delivery in informal settlements of Monwabisi in Khayelitsha, and the program was developed by the VPUU, the City of Cape Town and other stakeholders involved.  CitySpec: A Mobile Inspection Tool Improving Service DeliveryFormula D_: CitySpec Mobile Inspection Tool.  The struggle for informal settlements to receive adequate service delivery is an issue that invites meaningful engagement on how to minimize poor service delivery. And informal settlements are defined as residential areas situated on illegally occupied land or where housing is not in compliance with planning and building regulations. 6  The VPUU therefore, working with the community members and other interested stakeholders developed a City Spec Mobile App program in Khayelitsha, and this is a mobile inspection tool that looks to identify service delivery faults for improving essential services in informal settlements. 3  According to the VPUU website their aim for developing this program was to get authentic evidence of the service faults in the affected area, by deploying members of the community to gather the evidence. 3  The accuracy of this mobile app is validated by a VPUU program facilitator, who acknowledges that the city spec make reporting faults easy as the move from paper to technological reports goes straight to the municipality system and there is no errors of misinformation capturing and immediately receive response through email about the repair process. 10  This is significant in revealing the effectiveness of this project and how it has helped improve service delivery using the community and with the community responding positively to the change made by the city spec. As it is reported that in 2011 about 40% of 177 communal taps were faulty and a fault report was sent resulting in the Water and Sanitation Department repairing and seeking to increase functionality of the services to 90%. 10Formula D_: Facilitator Training Community MembersFormula D_: VPUU CitySpec Facilitator (Thulani Manci).  The people using the mobile app are community members trained in established workshops or training programs for efficient and effective participation on solving service delivery challenges. 3  Despite the VPUU website failing to explain the criteria for selection, but an individual within the project reveled that those volunteering community members are taken and trained. 10  It is said that the city spec mobile app monitored a wide range of services including water taps, toilets, streetlights, and other services, and has different alert codes for different faults and these are reported to the city. 3  The wide range of services covered by the city spec makes it imperative for solid communication between citizens and government, however, it does not guarantee that all reported faults will be attended and delivered adequately on a constant basis. The VPUU website also states that the fault reports are uploaded as picture attachment to an online database and the City of Cape Town takes charge of monitoring and repairing the faults using GPS for location areas and type of service reported. 3  In addition, the City of Cape Town had a similar project where it developed a GPS coordinate to enable repair teams to easily locate the toilets after faults reports by the community, and that resulted to 256 toilets in Khayelitsha in November of 2011 repaired and hundreds of doors and missing manhole covers replaced and raised others to prevent sewerage holes. 7Formula D_: Community Members Capturing FaultsFormula D_: Community Member Capturing FaultsFormula D_: Informal Settlements of Monwabisi6  Okurut, K.

Analysis and Lessons Learned  In the analysis of the City Spec project, the theory that will be used is the Participatory Democracy in an Age of Inequality by Decombe and Parvin. This theory is significant for the study because it explains how participatory democracy make ordinary people the centre of engagement and decision-making. It further explains the significance of citizen involvement in budgetary meetings, and this contributes to the development of citizen’s awareness, capacity of knowledge, and development of citizens to effectively participation giving democracy legitimacy by also holding the government officials accountable. 8Therefore, the establishment of the City Spec by the VPUU initially signify a sense of democracy because the project was brought to life by the coming together of different stakeholders deliberating how the project will operate and these includes the City of Cape Town, the German Development Bank, the community of Khayelitsha, community-based organizations and other stakeholders. Despite full participation of the different stakeholders involved it does not mean the effectiveness of their participation is equal, with the level of their financial contribution to the program being unequal. Since the centrality of this project is to place citizens at the centre of operations, Mugwaneza (2019) argues that public participation is based on the belief that the people affected by a decision have a right to be involved in the decision-making processes, and this includes the importance of their contribution influencing decisions. 9  Therefore, the VPUU project by involving community members in decision-making sessions or meetings and providing them with skills and knowledge of the mobile app through development workshop, it is exercising participatory democracy. This is significant with regards to the theory because through citizens direct involvement in the program using the mobile app, it also provides them with adequate information to hold the government to account and participate meaningfully in decision-making, resulting in legitimate and effective governance.  Unlike the GPS coordinates developed by the City of Cape Town which revealed the results of their project, it has been difficult to get information with regards to the success of the programs in the long run and how ordinary community members affected received the project as the community members involved in capturing fault report spoke highly of the cityspec program. This is to mean the sustainability of the program has not been identified in this work and the views of the people in Monwabisi other than those involved in the program. In the participatory democratic theory, Decombe and Parvin (2019) argue that opening democracy to a plurality of voices in this way might lead to tangible benefits in the quality of democratic decision-making. 8  This, however, is not a given that all who participate or given an opportunity to participate in decisions is reflective of their impact in decisions. It rather suggests that all participation of different stakeholders is welcomed but decisions of stakeholders holding higher power can easily overpower or suppress to an extent the decisions of the other stakeholders. Even though there is no evidence found that show to be the case in the running or operations of the cityspec program. This leave leaves Piper cited in Barolsky (2016) arguing that the community consultation that the VPUU engages in and the forums it creates is designed in ways that allows for very limited form of direct citizen participation in democratic decision-making. 1Therefore, the analysis of the cityspec program in Monwabisi informal settlements of Khayelitsha has revealed that the participation of community members in decision-making does exist to some extent and that the program is centered around citizen participation. That is because community volunteers trained to use the mobile monitor cellphone are directly involved in alerting the city and the department of water and sanitation about the service delivery faults and these stakeholders directly report back to the community volunteers about the plans to resolve and repair the services found with faults. However, the participation of the community members in direct decision-making and their effectiveness in not explicitly revealed even though it has been shown that they do participate. In addition, the VPUU signify high levels of democracy since community members not only participate in decisions but are provided with information to hold the government officials to account and that maximizes high level of transparency to an extent.9  Mugwaneza, B.

The organization has helped numerous newcomers from various world regions, including Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa, in their initial settlement process. These early steps, such as finding a place to live, job opportunities, learning English, and becoming familiar with Canada's legal system and health care, are all vital to establishing a solid foundation for each newcomer to create a healthy life in Canada. Furthermore, AWO programming includes a variety of activities that cater to the evolving needs of newcomers. As a result, more women and their families have better access to their network of peers and increased involvement in their communities.[i][1]The mission of AWO is to assist refugees and immigrants, especially those who have been affected by wars and persecution, with a special emphasis on women and their families. The organization strives to enhance their quality of life and promote their social and economic integration, enabling them to become active members of society and live with dignity.  [ii][2][i]  AWO official Website page:  https://afghanwomen.org/about-us/[ii]  AWO official Website page:  https://afghanwomen.org/about-us/mission-and-values/Origins and DevelopmentThe AWO had modest beginnings in 1990. It was founded by Adeena Niaizi, who, along with a few Afghan refugee women, initially ran the organization on a volunteer basis. The group was formed by like-minded women from the Afghan committee with the aim of supporting other Afghan women refugees. They started in a small office without any furniture. Fahima Fatah was the first official staff member of AWO and worked with a second-hand typewriter at a small desk. Despite the small office and limited resources, the group worked tirelessly to help more Afghan women and their families. They came together with a shared goal to make a positive impact in the lives of those who needed it the most. Meanwhile, The AWO operates like a tight-knit family, with its clients at the center of its extended family. As the organization grew, it began serving an increasingly diverse client base. The AWO's mission is to improve the quality of life for newcomers and refugees, helping them live with dignity and reach their full potential while promoting social and economic inclusion. The organization has successfully served over 19,000 clients who have experienced war and violence from countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, other Central Asian countries, the Middle East, South and East Asia, Africa, and Europe.  [i][1][i]  AWO official Website page:  https://afghanwomen.org/about-us/Organizational Structure, Membership, and FundingThe administrative structure of AWO comprises the founder, Vice President, treasurer, secretary, and staff members. In addition, AWO's funders include the Community Foundation of Mississauga, Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada, Ontario Trillium Foundation, Region of Peel, RBC Royal Bank, United Way, and Scotia Bank.Members of AWO will receive several benefits, including a membership card that is valid for one year, the right to vote in AWO elections, and the eligibility to be nominated for the AWO Board of Directors.

Please help us complete it.Major Projects and Events·Settlement ServicesThe Settlement Services Program of AWO assists more than 100 newly arrived landed immigrants and convention refugees every month to settle and integrate into Canadian society. Newcomers often find it challenging to access basic services such as health care, transportation, education, employment and shelter due to language barriers and lack of knowledge about the settlement process. However, AWO Settlement Services staff is well-trained and equipped to cater to their special needs. It offers a wide range of settlement services for families, including one-on-one services, information and orientation, interpretation and translation, assistance in filling forms and applying for benefits like SIN, PRC, CCTB, OHIP, assistance in finding housing (rentals and applying for subsidized housing), school/language training referral and enrollment, supportive counselling, accompaniment, follow-ups and referrals.·Needs AssessmentAs a part of the settlement and adaptation process, the first step is a needs assessment meeting. During this meeting, newcomers are informed about their rights and responsibilities as permanent residents in Canada. They are also provided with information about all the required documentation to access health care, employment and training opportunities, programs and education for their children, and the various services offered by the AWO to assist with the settlement process.·Youth ProgramOver the past year, the Youth Program of the Afghan Women’s Organization has been highly successful in catering to the needs of immigrant and refugee youth. The program aims to empower and support youth in various aspects of their lives and provides them with various services. These services include settlement services, mentorship, and civic engagement programs. Additionally, the program offers supportive and solution-oriented counselling to newcomer youth, which helps reduce social isolation and encourages them to participate in the wider community. The program has also provided assistance and counselling to several at-risk youths, including referrals to lawyers, support with court and school issues, and Aggression Replacement Training. Many youth have benefitted from the program, learning valuable skills in conflict mediation, which has helped them integrate into the wider community. Furthermore, the program offers skill development workshops that assist youth in developing leadership and public speaking skills, as well as empowering them with knowledge. The program also promotes awareness of Canadian culture and society among these youth.  [i]Moreover, The AWO offers various programs, including Global Connections, Let's Talk Not Hide, Women and Family Support Services, Senior Program, Mental Health and Wellness, Refugee Services, Community Connections, Employment Services, and English Language Classes.  [ii][4]The Job Search Workshops (JSW) offered by AWO are helpful for newcomers trying to determine their career paths and next steps. The program has been running successfully from 2014 to 2015 and has already assisted 195 clients. The program helps newcomers think through their long-term and short-term career goals and supports them through the initial job preparation process into a life-long process of skill-building and career development. It offers computer training classes and access to the computer lab while providing ongoing support. Clients are referred to schools and language services, Employment Ontario programs, career fairs, employment agencies, and apprenticeship programs to obtain their licenses in various trades and skill training. The program also helps foreign professionals by referring them to credential evaluation services. Clients are assisted in creating their resumes and receive follow-up services to assess their progress. They benefit from ongoing access to Internet services, photocopying, and the use of a fax machine. The AWO wishes all of its JSW participants great success in 2015.

12968,organization,Living Room Conversations ,https://participedia.net/organization/12968,Living Room Conversations is a non profit devoted to engaging individuals with opposing political opinions in a guided discussion.,0,2023-12-12,2023-12-12,426020,allisonpierce12,https://participedia.net/user/426020,426020,allisonpierce12,https://participedia.net/user/426020,en,,,,,,,,,non_profit_non_gov,,,,deliberative, participantled,,facilitate, inform,,,,,,,,," Mission and Purpose  Living Room Conversations is an organization intended to reverse the polarization and divide in society by encouraging guided conversations between people with countervailing beliefs and backgrounds. More specifically, the organization aims to empower ordinary citizens to engage in respectful dialogue with those of opposing views, thus enabling individuals to garner a more significant understanding of pressing political issues with the hopes of reaching common ground. Through respectful dialogue and consideration of different political opinions, Living Room Conversations fosters more harmonious communities and empathetic individuals.  Describing the benefits of civil dialogue,  founders of Living Room Conversations identified the purpose of the discussion  format and creation of the organization, writing, “Besides having the time and  structure to listen and reflect, specific aspects of Living Room Conversations  help to counter stereotypes and enlarge our tribes. For example, it is easier  to interrupt stereotypes when we encounter counter-stereotype information and  have the time to process it” [1]. By  providing a structured format for conversation, Living Room Conversations  allows individuals to actively listen to others and share their own opinions  within a safe, controlled setting. The organization offers citizens a platform  and tool to not only build greater understanding but also build meaningful and  mutually respectful relationships. This mission of counteracting the growing  polarization from political affiliations in the United States seeks to  encourage a more respectful, civil society based on intercommunal and  intracommunal conversations. The organization's name originates from the idea  that living rooms are often considered a place of gathering and socializing.  When a person receives an invite into someone else’s home, they generally feel  respected and valued, promoting respectful conversation [2]. While the living room is assumed to be a physical  location, modern technology allows people to connect with others through  virtual platforms. With these new forms of communication, Living Room  Conversations can build communities of understanding and growth both in-person  and online, transforming the typical definition of “living room.”  Origins and Development  Founded in 2010, Living Room Conversations is a non-profit organization which promotes healthy dialogue and political discussion. The organization’s founders, noting the lack of civil dialogue on political problems and increasing polarization in American culture, sought to use simple, structured conversations to build empathy and understanding. The founding members believed that while disagreement is inevitable, this disagreement should not lead to hopeless divides. Instead, Living Room Conversations sought to harness these fundamental differences to empower community members to seek better solutions in difficult circumstances. Moreover, founder Joan Blades teamed up with other dialogue experts to “create a structured, intimate conversation format that would  empower everyday citizens to discuss important issues with friends of differing  political affiliations and backgrounds”  [3]. They believed that if individuals engaged in a discussion where the intent and structure were disclosed, the dialogue would produce an atmosphere founded on respect and worthwhile transmission of ideas. Additionally, this personal, conversational format could breed new, long-lasting relationships amongst participants and encourage further discussion between dissenting individuals. By early 2011, the tested format of Living Room Conversations proved to succeed in creating more respectful, understanding dialogue surrounding controversial topics.  Following the pilot's success, Joan Blades  and Amanda Kathryn Roman joined forces to form a partnership and continue to  promote the mission of Living Room Conversations. They hired an advisory board  and established a website to launch Living Room Conversations, creating an  accessible format for individuals, small groups, and larger organizations. The  platform attracted its first notable conversation in 2013. This discussion was  co-hosted by Joan Blades and Mark Meckler, co-founder of the Tea Party  Patriots, finding common ground on controversial issues such as criminal  justice reform and the harms of capitalism. Moreover, Living Room Conversations constantly adapts and expands,  introducing new topics and partnering with new organizations. Particularly, the  ability to conduct Living Room Conversations through online formats as well as  in-person events allows the organization to collaborate with more participants  in new ways, bridging divides between people from all areas of the United  States [5].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Living Room Conversations structures itself around a core team, which is composed of executive directors, administrative managers, community engagement directors, and other organizational staff. These staff members run the administrative and outreach sides of the organization, coordinating with outside organizations and events to bring the Living Room Conversations to them. Positions include Community Engagement Partner, Youth Council Leader, Social Media Manager, Belonging and Inclusion Partner, and more.[5] In addition to the core team, others are involved with the coordination of Living Room Conversations. An advisory board services the organization by guiding staff members and other partners. Champions, a unique feature of the organization's structure, are in charge of connecting Living Room Conversations with people, organizations, and events that could utilize its services.  Living Room Conversations relies on funding to conduct its work. Through the help of individual and foundation donors, the organization utilizes donations to finance its events, support its staff, and expand programming. The organization currently receives no government funding, relying primarily on donations to continue the work. For certain events hosted by Living Room Conversations and its staff, a donation is required to attend. The organization urges consultants that use their guides in their work to donate a percentage of their fee; similarly, businesses are requested to ask their finance departments to make an appropriate donation.[6] These donations allow Living Room Conversations to continue creating and distributing resources to non-profits, faith communities, schools, and other organizations in need of increased dialogue.  Specializations, Methods and ToolsServicesLiving Room Conversations offers a multitude of services to help people engage in political discourse. They also offer a consultation option to help users find out which service best fits them. Living Room conversations continue to create custom services for users who request them and are associated with gaining political knowledge. Some of these users include The University of Miami Ohio, Boston Public Library, and UNC Pembroke among others. Some of their listed services include:  ·  Conversation Guide Adaptation -  Users can engage in a 20-minute conversation with a staffer to figure out if the guide they have created for themselves is the best it can be. Staff will advise on what topics need the most attention and advise on talking about touchy subjects in a calm and respectful manner.  ·  Customized Training -  Users can pick what their weaknesses are and work with staff on how to better their conversation skills and promote educational and respectful conversation.  ·  Program Design/Implementation Support -  Staff assists in collecting data to support a conversation as well as evaluating the strength of a potential conversation program.  ·  Host a Conversation -  Once a program is completed, a portal is opened to begin a Zoom conversation on the topics selected. Users can dictate the size of the group they wish while also having access to Living Room Conversations support and the Zoom tech helpline.  ·  Livestream Conversation Event -  Experienced users will have the opportunity to have their conversation co-hosted by an expert. These are often broadcast to new members to show the power of the political discourse they are engaging in. These events are often planned well in advance.  The services offered build upon one another; they continue to help people prepare to have tough conversations. The world continues to be in need of a way to bring people together as we increasingly push each other apart. Undoubtedly, one of the best and most effective tools offered by Living Room Conversations is their conversation guides. Grateful Living states ""They…have over 100 conversation guides based upon the current interests and needs of our users.""[7] These guides provide great information for people wanting to engage in conversation at all levels. It also presents people with an opportunity to pick something they are interested in as they continue to learn.Topic Specific Conversation GuidesAll topic walkthroughs are structured in a similar format. Once a topic is selected, the topic tab will ask open-ended questions for the two conversationalists to consider. For example, on the 'Free Speech' tab, questions are asked about the difference between hate speech and bullying or the effect of technology on free speech.[8] Similarly, the 'Student Debt' tab questions participants about free tuition versus costs to taxpayers.[9] While asking these questions, all topic tabs offer a small background paragraph, introducing the topic and clarifying needed information for discussion. Since all participants may not have the same level of understanding of issues, the beginning of each topic tab allows a small introduction.  After a topic is chosen, a host will begin the online meeting to engage around four to six people in the discussion. The meeting begins with an introduction, setting the tone for the rest of the discussion. Participants get to know each other during a short introductory period. After introductions, all participants will be expected to agree to the conversation agreements. Also found on the website, the conversation agreement outlines specific standards of the discussion, encouraging participants to be curious, respectful, authentic, purposeful, and accountable.  Once the standard of conversation has been set, the discussion of the topic can begin. This part of the conversation is broken down into different rounds based on the topic. The first round is a more in-depth ""get to know you"" between participants. Rather than just an introduction, guests are asked to look a little deeper and explain their goals for not just the conversation but their community and the country. This section also provides time for guests to give additional background on themselves, which may explain why they hold their opinions. Clarifying what drives individuals' perspectives on the world, allows other participants to view each other more holistically, rather than simply judging them based solely on opinions. Through this section of the conversation process, Living Room Conversations provides a guided, structured time for participants to develop trust and understanding with one another.  The largest and most important round is round two. During this section of the conversation, participants begin to get to the heart of the topic. One participant will begin by reading the introductory paragraph mentioned above to the group. From there, each participant chooses one of the offered questions to answer uninterrupted. Within each topic tab, under round two, participants will find different questions about the topic. For example, under the student debt tab, there are five questions that range from economic questions to personal experiences.[10] On the 'Free Speech' tab there are questions about engagement of free speech on social media as well as questions about political correctness.[11] The questions listed on each topic address all sides of the issue. The questions are asked in an unbiased way that allows everyone from either side of the debate to engage with the questions. After each participant has had an opportunity to answer uninterrupted, discussion can begin. Participants are allowed to ask follow-up questions or respond to different answers. Participants will also have a chance to answer or ask questions that are not listed on the topic tab within the confounds of the conversation agreement.  As questioning and discussion wrap up, round three will begin, which encourages guests to reflect on the conversation they had. This round asks participants to reflect on what common ground was found between various perspectives as well as any challenges individuals faced. Once the meeting has ended, participants are asked to give Living Room Conversations feedback about their conversation. This is also a time to exchange contacts between participants to engage in more conversations later.  These guides allow a structured conversation with specific timing. Utilizing structure and timing allows conversations to stay within a given guideline, preventing one participant from dominating the conversation. Living Room Conversations intentionally structures the conversation to encourage listening and reflection, ensuring that participants ""listen five times more than they speak, and both the listening and speaking are reflective, exploratory of self and other, and encouraged by the structure and timing of the conversation to be significantly slower than ordinary engagement, whether face-to-face or online"".[12] Though some participants may find it difficult to speak on charged topics or struggle to share personal opinions, Living Room Conversations provides questions that are designed to encourage guests to feel welcome in sharing their opinion. While the structure of the organization seeks to engage in online or in-person meetings with different guests, anyone is welcome to use these topic guides in any setting. For any individual hoping to engage in an emotionally charged conversation, the conversation agreement, the structured rounds, and pre-determined questions can be used to ease the awkwardness and foster better dialogue.[13]  Major Projects and Events  Most events hosted by Living Room Conversations are facilitated discussions between groups. These conversations' format ranges based upon the specific event. Living Room Conversations hosts staff-led conversations, which are typically conducted online and open to any viewer. Example events include discussing the topic of forgiveness, introductions to Living Room Conversations and its mission, and other trainings intended to encourage thoughtful, civil dialogue.[14] Additionally, anyone can start a conversation themselves by logging into the Living Room Conversations conversation platform, Kazm. Participating hosts can create their own conversations online for other users to join. If an organization or individual prefers to host an in-person conversation, they can utilize pre-made facilitation guides for in-person conversations among local participants.  Living Room Conversations, though run by its staff, champions, and advisory board, relies on the participation of various communities. In particular, the organization highlights many communities and community leaders on its website that contribute to events and partnerships. Faith communities regularly participate in conversations. Living Room Conversations partners with many religious denominations ""to deepen relationships within their communities, address tensions, invite neighbors in and even talk to sister faith communities, both locally and in other states.""[15] Participating congregations participate in regularly scheduled trainings, host dialogues with sister congregations, and discuss difficult topics in a civil, respectful way. For example, Living Room Conversations offers conversation guides specifically for faith communities, including ""Faith in Politics,"" ""Religious Freedom and Non-Discrimination,"" and ""Race and Faith Communities."" At a Christian church in Boise, Idaho, a pastor hosted forty-two members of the congregation in a discussion about abortion, in which the congregation could hear various perspectives and gain insight into their community's members.  Other organizations across the country have also utilized Living Room Conversations and their facilitation guides to promote community inclusion and healthy dialogue. Particularly, policing and community relations with the police can be a difficult topic to tackle; Living Room Conversations offers guides and resources to promote successful discussions between communities with disagreements in this area. Estes Valley Restorative Justice Center in Colorado hosts monthly discussions in partnership with Living Room Conversations, in which local police officers, residents, and Restorative Justice Center members convene to learn from one another.[16] Topics range from gun responsibility, homelessness, and other relevant issues that touch the town of Estes Park.  Schools can also utilize Living Room Conversations through a program titled Allsides for Schools. In collaboration with the National Association for Community Mediation (NAFCM), Living Room Conversations designed a School Community Toolbox designed to lead workshops in skills such as conflict resolution, restorative facilitation, and community dialogues in schools. The program is intended to promote stronger community and constructive discussions in schools, challenging participants to engage critically and build trust with each other. Additionally, the conversations prepare students to thoughtfully participate in democratic processes and allow teachers to facilitate conversations about current events, controversial issues, and other dialogues without bias and division; Living Room Conversations advocates strongly for non-partisan engagement with such issues, stating, ""Allsides for Schools helps educators have these discussions and teach essential skills in critical thinking, collaboration, listening and respectful discourse, media and digital literacy and social-emotional learning. Our unique focus on building relationships and revealing multiple viewpoints across the political spectrum avoids the potential problems with bias and disrespecting individual beliefs.""[17] AllSides for Schools provides specific lesson plans, online tools, and in-class discussion devices that stimulate critical thinking, respectful dialogue, and media literacy. These resources are prepared with middle school, high school, and college ages in mind, as these students are cognitively ready to discuss controversial and political topics.  Similarly, Living Room Conversations partners with libraries across the country to implement conversational programming. Through Living Room Conversations, libraries gain access to conversation guides that can facilitate civil dialogues on relevant topics to the library's local community. Living Room Conversations also offers training prior to facilitations, allowing library staff or volunteers to confidently deliver the facilitation of the conversations. Living Room Conversations can be an ongoing program for the library or a singular event for a topic that a facilitator would like to discuss with library patrons. In a description of the programming, the Colorado Department of Education highlighted an interview in 2023 with Living Room Conversations Libraries Partner, Annie Caplan, who described the organization's library events, stating, ""Living Room Conversations helps libraries offer and support community dialogue programming, deepening the library's role as an engaging, inclusive community center. Our conversation model is designed to build understanding and bridge divides between participants. Living Room Conversations enables libraries to expand their community impact by equipping them with tools to foster relationships and connections between community members and patrons.""[18]  Alongside schools and libraries, businesses and workplaces can engage with Living Room Conversations. As hybrid work models and generational expectations change, Living Room Conversations as an organization highlights the importance of communication and trust among coworkers, especially those with generational gaps. Managers and employees can also benefit from increased dialogue. The structure of Living Room Conversations in businesses is similar to libraries and schools, as the organization provides conversation guides and customizable training to engage workplace leaders in dialogue with other staff.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Living Room Conversations aims to promote healthy dialogue across divides such as political affiliations, age differences, racial backgrounds, and other factors that prevent people from engaging in civil debates. Through guided conversations and facilitation training, the organization hopes to build understanding and trust in communities. Though the effectiveness of these measures is difficult to determine, many participants of the conversations feel like the conversations are productive and offer beneficial lessons. For example, a facilitator in Minnesota who began hosting Living Room Conversations as an organizational development consultant notes the emotional progress that may come from the dialogue, remarking, ""One woman who participated in three conversations said it made her a different and better person. It's not always like that and some people have a less-than-ideal experience, but most people really enjoy it…Conflict that has a goal of connecting people more deeply is good. If you and I have a difficult conversation and we understand each other better — that's good. Conflict that is about ego and power isn't good. I think people are afraid of conflict going awry. But when there is a container for it, like a structured conversation, conflict may be present but it isn't going to swamp the conversation and break whatever tenuous threads connect us.""[19] Although the conversations are not guaranteed to build trust or foster personal growth, participants are granted the structured opportunity to respectfully disagree and learn from one another, which many argue is a positive experience.  At Grace United Methodist Church in Franklin, Indiana, congregation members began facilitating Living Room Conversations as a space for the community to learn how to civilly debate contentious issues. Though the church's monthly meetings are viewed positively and have garnered benefits, the group admitted that the participants tend to have more liberal viewpoints, hindering the conversation from being totally balanced among all political perspectives. Due to participation in Living Room Conversations being voluntary, all viewpoints may not be represented. This lack of equal participation among diverse perspectives may present a challenge to the missions of the conversations. Without participants with opposing political positions, the potential benefits of the discussion may be lost.  References  [1] Shryack, Jessica, et al.

12972,organization,Purpose Power Town Hall Tour,https://participedia.net/organization/12972,Purpose Power created a town hall tour lasting from March May 2019 to engage citizen discussion about a variety of topics.,0,2023-12-12,2023-12-12,426026,dallasl,https://participedia.net/user/426026,426026,dallasl,https://participedia.net/user/426026,en,,,,New York,,United States,40.6781784,-73.9441579,non_profit_non_gov,,,,community, deliberative, informal,facilitate, propose, manage,citizenship, political,,media, governance,,," Mission and Purpose  Through her experience in the social sector working on redefining brands and producing events for non-profit organizations and her experience in the political realm assisting in Hilary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, Alicia Bonner Ness witnessed problems in democracy. The main issue she witnessed through her experiences was that lack of effective communication is at the core of the problems the nation faces. [1] She saw just how isolating social media and technology can be because we spend time interacting with people we know, which limits our perspectives on the world. [2] Ness also saw just how toxic “tribal politics” was to political discourse. [3]  Through the Purpose Power Town Halls, Ness hopes to foster communication across people with different perspectives and experiences to “create an open and inviting space in which to envision the better future we all want.” Through facilitating conversation with people across the political spectrum, people can expand their understanding of the world and hopefully use that knowledge to participate in civic engagement. The toolkit provided in the meeting helps participants apply what they learned in their community. [1]Origins and Development  Alicia Bonner Ness founded the Purpose Power Town Hall after leaving the social sector to pursue assisting the Hilary Clinton campaign in 2016, she saw how “our failure to communicate is at the heart of our political dysfunction.” [1]  So, she began facilitating conversations in North Brooklyn. Over the course of 90 minutes, attendees reflected and answered five core questions:What are the values you hope will guide your political leaders?  Name a leader you admire. What qualities make them effective?  What are the qualities of a good civic citizen?  How can leaders and citizens collaborate to strengthen our community?  Imagine you have fallen asleep for ten years and awakened to find that our democracy is thriving. What do you see?After answering them individually, everyone is invited to share their thoughts with the group. The facilitator scribes the responses for all to see. The Brooklyn workshops are a part of the Vision Project, which is a coalition of organizations to envision a future for the Brooklyn community. [1] Ness wanted to expand this discussion to across the nation, which is why she launches the Purpose Power Town Hall Tour, which occurred across 15 cities across 15 states, including: New England, New York, Virgina, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Colorado, Kansas, Texas, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida. [3]  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  One of the biggest challenges for this organization is funding. [2] Alicia Bonner Ness launched a crowdfunding campaign on ifundwomen.com to raise funds for costs associated with the tour, including, venues, staff and operations, promotion, and an “engagement toolkit,” which is given to participants to help continue civic engagement and communication in their community. The campaign is closed and raised $8,150 out of their $75,000 goal. [3]  In the meetings, participants are provided with blank notebooks to collect their thoughts. These notebooks were generously donated by Unruled. [4]  Their May 11th, 2019 Town Hall was co-sponsored by the Serve America Movement (SAM), which is an independent political party designed for those that are fed up with the tribal politics that defines the majority of American politics today. SAM is not focused on candidates or representatives, but rather on people and participation. Their goals focus on policies that give people more power such as voting and gerrymandering reforms. [1]  Specializations, Methods and Tools  The meetings focus on transmitting four core skills: dialogue, understanding, trust, and progress. [3] They are held in public spaces. For example, in Hartford, the event was held at the Hartford Public Library Center for Contemporary Culture. [5]In Nashville, participants met at Bongo Java Cafe. The NYC Town Hall was in the civic hall. In DC attendees met at Open Gov Hub. [6] Each event has three parts. In the first part attendees make meaningful connections, where they engage with others and find shared values. Then, they imagine future possibilities where they join group discussions and collaborate together. The last part is where they commit to take action, promising a future of sustained engagement. Some locations have guest speakers to begin. For example, in Hartford, Dr. Oz Griebel spoke. [1]  The event is free and open to anyone that can come. It is unclear how exactly the cities were chosen, except we can assume that they wanted highly populated cities to encourage civic engagement. Although originally there were 15 selected cities, only three were actually visited, based on the organization's facebook and instagram. [5] [6]  The process of each of the meetings went as follows:Know your neighbor: Each person says their name, where they are from, and a word that describes them.  Establish community guidelines: shape community guidelines that they will adhere to during their time together. Example: using “I” statements discourages generalizing and emphasizes personal experience. These commitments create a sense of community where individuals can feel safe to feel vulnerable and imaginative.  Know your mind, have some fun: Participants can use markers to reflect in notebooks before speaking to the group. Colorful markers help people think imaginatively, which is necessary when discussing the possible future.  Connect with others: Now, people pair up to warm up with a couple of questions. Some of them include: Why are you here? What makes you angry? What are you afraid of? These questions help build trust among the group to continue into more thought-provoking discussion.  Share your values and vision the future: participants then share their most important values in life. After this, leaders invite the group to answer the following question, “Imagine you have fallen asleep for 10 years and awakened to find our democracy thriving. What do you hope to see?”  Be real about the present: Now, participants are invited to acknowledge the obstacles that block the envisioned future. Next, they can create paths to overcome these obstacles and create a future they want to live in.  Commit to solidarity: attendees pair up to commit to take action and check in with each other to ensure they are upholding their commitments. [4]Influence, Outcomes, and Effects  Over a 2 month period, Purpose Power connected with almost 200 people from more than 25 states. [5] Although the original plan was to visit 15 states, according to the organization’s Facebook and Instagram, the tour went to three cities: NYC, Hartford, and Washington DC. The attendees all have the tools needed to continue important political discourse in their communities and have connected with other people with similar values and goals.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Overall, Purpose Power Town Hall was successful in facilitating democratic discussion. It provided thought-provoking discussion in an inclusive setting.However, it also shows what lack of funding does for democracy and democratic entities. Without sufficient funds, the tour was unable to be fully completed as the founder had originally planned. Since 2019, there has not been any word of Purpose Power on any forum.

12974,organization,Living Room Conversations,https://participedia.net/organization/12974,Living Room Conversations is a non profit organization dedicated to guiding political discussions between people with opposing political opinions.,0,2023-12-12,2023-12-12,426020,allisonpierce12,https://participedia.net/user/426020,426020,allisonpierce12,https://participedia.net/user/426020,en,,,,,,,,,non_profit_non_gov,,,,deliberative, informal, participantled,facilitate, inform,,public_participation,,,education,,,," Mission and Purpose  Living Room Conversations is an organization intended to reverse the polarization and divide in society by encouraging guided conversations between people with countervailing beliefs and backgrounds. More specifically, the organization aims to empower ordinary citizens to engage in respectful dialogue with those of opposing views, thus enabling individuals to garner a more significant understanding of pressing political issues with the hopes of reaching common ground. Through respectful dialogue and consideration of different political opinions, Living Room Conversations fosters more harmonious communities and empathetic individuals.  Describing the benefits of civil dialogue, founders of Living Room Conversations identified the purpose of the discussion format and creation of the organization, writing, “Besides having the time and structure to listen and reflect, specific aspects of Living Room Conversations help to counter stereotypes and enlarge our tribes. For example, it is easier to interrupt stereotypes when we encounter counter-stereotype information and have the time to process it” [1]. By providing a structured format for conversation, Living Room Conversations allows individuals to actively listen to others and share their own opinions within a safe, controlled setting. The organization offers citizens a platform and tool to not only build greater understanding but also build meaningful and mutually respectful relationships. This mission of counteracting the growing polarization from political affiliations in the United States seeks to encourage a more respectful, civil society based on intercommunal and intracommunal conversations.  The organization's name originates from the idea that living rooms are often considered a place of gathering and socializing. When a person receives an invite into someone else’s home, they generally feel respected and valued, promoting respectful conversation [2]. While the living  room is assumed to be a physical location, modern technology allows people to connect with others through virtual platforms. With these new forms of communication, Living Room Conversations can build communities of understanding and growth both in-person and online, transforming the typical definition of “living room.”  Origins and Development  Founded in 2010, Living Room Conversations is a non-profit organization which promotes healthy dialogue and political discussion. The organization’s founders, noting the lack of civil dialogue on political problems and increasing polarization in American culture, sought to use simple, structured conversations to build empathy and understanding. The founding members believed that while disagreement is inevitable, this disagreement should not lead to hopeless divides. Instead, Living Room Conversations sought to harness these fundamental differences to empower community members to seek better solutions in difficult circumstances. Moreover, founder Joan Blades teamed up with other dialogue experts to “create a structured, intimate conversation format that would empower everyday citizens to discuss important issues with friends of differing political affiliations and backgrounds” [3]. They believed that if individuals engaged in a discussion where the intent and structure were disclosed, the dialogue would produce an atmosphere founded on respect and worthwhile transmission of ideas. Additionally, this personal, conversational format could breed new, long-lasting relationships amongst participants and encourage further discussion between dissenting individuals. By early 2011, the tested format of Living Room Conversations proved to succeed in creating more respectful, understanding dialogue surrounding controversial topics.  Following the pilot's success, Joan Blades and Amanda Kathryn Roman joined forces to form a partnership and continue to promote the mission of Living Room Conversations. They  hired an advisory board and established a website to launch Living Room Conversations, creating an accessible format for individuals, small groups, and larger organizations. The platform attracted its first notable conversation in 2013. This discussion was co-hosted by Joan Blades and Mark Meckler, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, finding common ground on controversial issues such as criminal justice reform and the harms of capitalism. Moreover, Living Room Conversations constantly adapts and expands, introducing new topics and partnering with new organizations. Particularly, the ability to conduct Living Room Conversations through online formats as well as in-person events allows the organization to collaborate with more participants in new ways, bridging divides between people from all areas of the United States [5].  Organizational Structure, Membership, and Funding  Living Room Conversations structures itself around a core team, which is composed of executive directors, administrative managers, community engagement directors, and other organizational staff. These staff members run the administrative and outreach sides of the organization, coordinating with outside organizations and events to bring the Living Room Conversations to them. Positions include Community Engagement Partner, Youth Council Leader, Social Media Manager, Belonging and Inclusion Partner, and more.[5] In addition to the core team, others are involved with the coordination of Living Room Conversations. An advisory board services the organization by guiding staff members and other partners. Champions, a unique feature of the organization's structure, are in charge of connecting Living Room Conversations with people, organizations, and events that could utilize its services.  Living Room Conversations relies on funding to conduct its work. Through the help of individual and foundation donors, the organization utilizes donations to finance its events, support its staff, and expand programming. The organization currently receives no government funding, relying primarily on donations to continue the work. For certain events hosted by Living Room Conversations and its staff, a donation is required to attend. The organization urges consultants that use their guides in their work to donate a percentage of their fee; similarly, businesses are requested to ask their finance departments to make an appropriate donation.[6] These donations allow Living Room Conversations to continue creating and distributing resources to non-profits, faith communities, schools, and other organizations in need of increased dialogue.  Specializations, Methods and ToolsServicesLiving Room Conversations offers a multitude of services to help people engage in political discourse. They also offer a consultation option to help users find out which service best fits them. Living Room conversations continue to create custom services for users who request them and are associated with gaining political knowledge. Some of these users include The University of Miami Ohio, Boston Public Library, and UNC Pembroke among others. Some of their listed services include:  ·  Conversation Guide Adaptation -  Users can engage in a 20-minute conversation with a staffer to figure out if the guide they have created for themselves is the best it can be. Staff will advise on what topics need the most attention and advise on talking about touchy subjects in a calm and respectful manner.  ·  Customized Training -  Users can pick what their weaknesses are and work with staff on how to better their conversation skills and promote educational and respectful conversation.  ·  Program Design/Implementation Support -  Staff assists in collecting data to support a conversation as well as evaluating the strength of a potential conversation program.  ·  Host a Conversation -  Once a program is completed, a portal is opened to begin a Zoom conversation on the topics selected. Users can dictate the size of the group they wish while also having access to Living Room Conversations support and the Zoom tech helpline.  ·  Livestream Conversation Event -  Experienced users will have the opportunity to have their conversation co-hosted by an expert. These are often broadcast to new members to show the power of the political discourse they are engaging in. These events are often planned well in advance.  The services offered build upon one another; they continue to help people prepare to have tough conversations. The world continues to be in need of a way to bring people together as we increasingly push each other apart. Undoubtedly, one of the best and most effective tools offered by Living Room Conversations is their conversation guides. Grateful Living states ""They...have over 100 conversation guides based upon the current interests and needs of our users.""[7] These guides provide great information for people wanting to engage in conversation at all levels. It also presents people with an opportunity to pick something they are interested in as they continue to learn.Topic Specific Conversation GuidesAll topic walkthroughs are structured in a similar format. Once a topic is selected, the topic tab will ask open-ended questions for the two conversationalists to consider. For example, on the 'Free Speech' tab, questions are asked about the difference between hate speech and bullying or the effect of technology on free speech.[8] Similarly, the 'Student Debt' tab questions participants about free tuition versus costs to taxpayers.[9] While asking these questions, all topic tabs offer a small background paragraph, introducing the topic and clarifying needed information for discussion. Since all participants may not have the same level of understanding of issues, the beginning of each topic tab allows a small introduction.  After a topic is chosen, a host will begin the online meeting to engage around four to six people in the discussion. The meeting begins with an introduction, setting the tone for the rest of the discussion. Participants get to know each other during a short introductory period. After introductions, all participants will be expected to agree to the conversation agreements. Also found on the website, the conversation agreement outlines specific standards of the discussion, encouraging participants to be curious, respectful, authentic, purposeful, and accountable.  Once the standard of conversation has been set, the discussion of the topic can begin. This part of the conversation is broken down into different rounds based on the topic. The first round is a more in-depth ""get to know you"" between participants. Rather than just an introduction, guests are asked to look a little deeper and explain their goals for not just the conversation but their community and the country. This section also provides time for guests to give additional background on themselves, which may explain why they hold their opinions. Clarifying what drives individuals' perspectives on the world, allows other participants to view  each other more holistically, rather than simply judging them based solely on opinions. Through this section of the conversation process, Living Room Conversations provides a guided, structured time for participants to develop trust and understanding with one another.  The largest and most important round is round two. During this section of the conversation, participants begin to get to the heart of the topic. One participant will begin by reading the introductory paragraph mentioned above to the group. From there, each participant chooses one of the offered questions to answer uninterrupted. Within each topic tab, under round two, participants will find different questions about the topic. For example, under the student debt tab, there are five questions that range from economic questions to personal experiences.[10] On the 'Free Speech' tab there are questions about engagement of free speech on social media as well as questions about political correctness.[11] The questions listed on each topic address all sides of the issue. The questions are asked in an unbiased way that allows everyone from either side of the debate to engage with the questions. After each participant has had an opportunity to answer uninterrupted, discussion can begin. Participants are allowed to ask follow-up questions or respond to different answers. Participants will also have a chance to answer or ask questions that are not listed on the topic tab within the confounds of the conversation agreement.  As questioning and discussion wrap up, round three will begin, which encourages guests to reflect on the conversation they had. This round asks participants to reflect on what common ground was found between various perspectives as well as any challenges individuals faced. Once the meeting has ended, participants are asked to give Living Room Conversations feedback about their conversation. This is also a time to exchange contacts between participants to engage in more conversations later.  These guides allow a structured conversation with specific timing. Utilizing structure and timing allows conversations to stay within a given guideline, preventing one participant from dominating the conversation. Living Room Conversations intentionally structures the conversation to encourage listening and reflection, ensuring that participants ""listen five times more than they speak, and both the listening and speaking are reflective, exploratory of self and other, and encouraged by the structure and timing of the conversation to be significantly slower than ordinary engagement, whether face-to-face or online"".[12] Though some participants may find it difficult to speak on charged topics or struggle to share personal opinions, Living Room Conversations provides questions that are designed to encourage guests to feel welcome in sharing their opinion. While the structure of the organization seeks to engage in online or in- person meetings with different guests, anyone is welcome to use these topic guides in any setting. For any individual hoping to engage in an emotionally charged conversation, the conversation agreement, the structured rounds, and pre-determined questions can be used to ease the awkwardness and foster better dialogue.[13]  Major Projects and Events  Most events hosted by Living Room Conversations are facilitated discussions between groups. These conversations' format ranges based upon the specific event. Living Room Conversations hosts staff-led conversations, which are typically conducted online and open to any viewer. Example events include discussing the topic of forgiveness, introductions to Living Room Conversations and its mission, and other trainings intended to encourage thoughtful, civil dialogue.[14] Additionally, anyone can start a conversation themselves by logging into the Living Room Conversations conversation platform, Kazm. Participating hosts can create their  own conversations online for other users to join. If an organization or individual prefers to host an in-person conversation, they can utilize pre-made facilitation guides for in-person conversations among local participants.  Living Room Conversations, though run by its staff, champions, and advisory board, relies on the participation of various communities. In particular, the organization highlights many communities and community leaders on its website that contribute to events and partnerships. Faith communities regularly participate in conversations. Living Room Conversations partners with many religious denominations ""to deepen relationships within their communities, address tensions, invite neighbors in and even talk to sister faith communities, both locally and in other states.""[15] Participating congregations participate in regularly scheduled trainings, host dialogues with sister congregations, and discuss difficult topics in a civil, respectful way. For example, Living Room Conversations offers conversation guides specifically for faith communities, including ""Faith in Politics,"" ""Religious Freedom and Non-Discrimination,"" and ""Race and Faith Communities."" At a Christian church in Boise, Idaho, a pastor hosted forty-two members of the congregation in a discussion about abortion, in which the congregation could hear various perspectives and gain insight into their community's members.  Other organizations across the country have also utilized Living Room Conversations and their facilitation guides to promote community inclusion and healthy dialogue. Particularly, policing and community relations with the police can be a difficult topic to tackle; Living Room Conversations offers guides and resources to promote successful discussions between communities with disagreements in this area. Estes Valley Restorative Justice Center in Colorado hosts monthly discussions in partnership with Living Room Conversations, in which local police officers, residents, and Restorative Justice Center members convene to learn from  one another.[16] Topics range from gun responsibility, homelessness, and other relevant issues that touch the town of Estes Park.  Schools can also utilize Living Room Conversations through a program titled Allsides for Schools. In collaboration with the National Association for Community Mediation (NAFCM), Living Room Conversations designed a School Community Toolbox designed to lead workshops in skills such as conflict resolution, restorative facilitation, and community dialogues in schools. The program is intended to promote stronger community and constructive discussions in schools, challenging participants to engage critically and build trust with each other. Additionally, the conversations prepare students to thoughtfully participate in democratic processes and allow teachers to facilitate conversations about current events, controversial issues, and other dialogues without bias and division; Living Room Conversations advocates strongly for non-partisan engagement with such issues, stating, ""Allsides for Schools helps educators have these discussions and teach essential skills in critical thinking, collaboration, listening and respectful discourse, media and digital literacy and social-emotional learning. Our unique focus on building relationships and revealing multiple viewpoints across the political spectrum avoids the potential problems with bias and disrespecting individual beliefs.""[17] AllSides for Schools provides specific lesson plans, online tools, and in-class discussion devices that stimulate critical thinking, respectful dialogue, and media literacy. These resources are prepared with middle school, high school, and college ages in mind, as these students are cognitively ready to discuss controversial and political topics.  Similarly, Living Room Conversations partners with libraries across the country to implement conversational programming. Through Living Room Conversations, libraries gain access to conversation guides that can facilitate civil dialogues on relevant topics to the library's  local community. Living Room Conversations also offers training prior to facilitations, allowing library staff or volunteers to confidently deliver the facilitation of the conversations. Living Room Conversations can be an ongoing program for the library or a singular event for a topic that a facilitator would like to discuss with library patrons. In a description of the programming, the Colorado Department of Education highlighted an interview in 2023 with Living Room Conversations Libraries Partner, Annie Caplan, who described the organization's library events, stating, ""Living Room Conversations helps libraries offer and support community dialogue programming, deepening the library's role as an engaging, inclusive community center. Our conversation model is designed to build understanding and bridge divides between participants. Living Room Conversations enables libraries to expand their community impact by equipping them with tools to foster relationships and connections between community members and patrons.""[18]  Alongside schools and libraries, businesses and workplaces can engage with Living Room Conversations. As hybrid work models and generational expectations change, Living Room Conversations as an organization highlights the importance of communication and trust among coworkers, especially those with generational gaps. Managers and employees can also benefit from increased dialogue. The structure of Living Room Conversations in businesses is similar to libraries and schools, as the organization provides conversation guides and customizable training to engage workplace leaders in dialogue with other staff.  Analysis and Lessons Learned  Living Room Conversations aims to promote healthy dialogue across divides such as political affiliations, age differences, racial backgrounds, and other factors that prevent people  from engaging in civil debates. Through guided conversations and facilitation training, the organization hopes to build understanding and trust in communities. Though the effectiveness of these measures is difficult to determine, many participants of the conversations feel like the conversations are productive and offer beneficial lessons. For example, a facilitator in Minnesota who began hosting Living Room Conversations as an organizational development consultant notes the emotional progress that may come from the dialogue, remarking, ""One woman who participated in three conversations said it made her a different and better person. It's not always like that and some people have a less-than-ideal experience, but most people really enjoy it...Conflict that has a goal of connecting people more deeply is good. If you and I have a difficult conversation and we understand each other better — that's good. Conflict that is about ego and power isn't good. I think people are afraid of conflict going awry. But when there is a container for it, like a structured conversation, conflict may be present but it isn't going to swamp the conversation and break whatever tenuous threads connect us.""[19] Although the conversations are not guaranteed to build trust or foster personal growth, participants are granted the structured opportunity to respectfully disagree and learn from one another, which many argue is a positive experience.  At Grace United Methodist Church in Franklin, Indiana, congregation members began facilitating Living Room Conversations as a space for the community to learn how to civilly debate contentious issues. Though the church's monthly meetings are viewed positively and have garnered benefits, the group admitted that the participants tend to have more liberal viewpoints, hindering the conversation from being totally balanced among all political perspectives. Due to participation in Living Room Conversations being voluntary, all viewpoints may not be represented. This lack of equal participation among diverse perspectives may present a challenge  to the missions of the conversations. Without participants with opposing political positions, the potential benefits of the discussion may be lost.  References  [1] Shryack, Jessica, et al.

Voice operates in a context where civic space and power is shifting at a fast pace, and often closing rather than opening. Where the narrative is negative and underlining marginalisation and vulnerability, rather than the dreams and successful steps made towards a better, more inclusive world.Voice is implemented in ten countries in Africa and Asia.  Voice is an initiative of and financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands as part of their overall policy framework ‘Dialogue and Dissent’ (future Power of Voices) and is executed by a consortium between Oxfam Novib and Hivos. Hivos is the coordinated body in four countries: Indonesia, Philippines, Kenya and Tanzania , while Oxfam coordinates Voice in six: Laos, Cambodia, Uganda, Niger, Mali and Nigeria.  About Hivos  Hivos is an international organisation that seeks new solutions to persistent global issues. With smart projects in the right places, they oppose discrimination, inequality, abuse of power and the unsustainable use of the planet’s resources. Counterbalance alone, however, is not enough. Hivos’ primary focus is achieving structural change. This is why Hivos cooperates with innovative businesses, citizens and their organisations. Hivos shares a dream with them of sustainable economies and inclusive societies. More about HivosAbout Oxfam Novib  Oxfam Novib is part of a global confederation of people working together to end the injustice of poverty for everyone.

And they won’t stop until every person on the planet can enjoy life free from poverty. Their vision is a just world without poverty.
