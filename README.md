# Participedia AI Chatbot

## Purpose
The Participedia AI Chatbot project was initiated to resolve critical usability challenges within the Participedia platform, a global repository for participatory democracy practices. Participedia offers vast datasets categorized into cases, methods, and organizations. However, users often faced difficulties accessing and navigating this extensive information, particularly when searching for specific insights.

The chatbot utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable intuitive, human-like interactions. By understanding and responding to user queries, the chatbot simplifies information retrieval, providing personalized, relevant results in real time. This enhancement aims to:
- **Increase User Engagement**: An intuitive, interactive chatbot interface promotes engagement by reducing friction in the data retrieval process.
- **Enhance Usability**: Simplifying the search for participatory democracy practices ensures that the platform becomes more user-friendly and accessible to a diverse audience.
- **Empower Stakeholders**: Researchers, educators, and practitioners gain quick and effortless access to critical insights, enabling them to make data-driven decisions or enhance their learning.

## Key Features
1. **Dynamic Query Processing**: The chatbot leverages NLP models to interpret user queries and retrieve the most contextually relevant information from Participedia's datasets. This feature supports a wide range of natural language inputs, from specific queries like “What are citizen juries?” to broader questions like “How does participatory budgeting work in Canada?”
2. **Real-World Examples**: Responses generated by the chatbot are enriched with real-world examples from Participedia’s datasets. 
    - **Cases**: Provide detailed narratives of actual participatory democracy implementations (e.g., participatory budgeting projects in Porto Alegre, Brazil).
    - **Methods**: Include descriptions of techniques like deliberative polling and citizen juries.
    - **Organizations**: Highlight profiles of advocacy groups or institutions promoting participatory practices.
3. **User Feedback Mechanism**: To ensure the chatbot evolves and improves over time, a feedback loop has been integrated.
    - Users can rate responses as helpful (thumbs-up) or unhelpful (thumbs-down).
4. **Accessible Interface**: A clean, minimalistic interface guides users with sample queries and placeholder text. Responses are clearly structured, featuring concise summaries with links to detailed resources.

## System Design

### Architecture Overview
1. **Query Classification Pipeline**: Categorizes user queries into predefined categories (cases, methods, organizations).
2. **FAISS-Based Retrieval System**: High-speed similarity search and clustering of embeddings.
3. **RAG-Based QA Pipeline**: Combines FAISS retrieval with a fine-tuned T5 model for generating contextual and accurate responses.
4. **Frontend**: Built using Streamlit and Flask for seamless user interaction.

### Workflow
1. **User Input**: The user types a question into the chatbot.
2. **Query Classification**: The query is classified into categories.
3. **Data Retrieval**: FAISS retrieves relevant embeddings.
4. **Response Generation**: The T5 model generates a concise response.
5. **User Feedback**: Users rate responses for refinement.

## Methodology

### Data Sources
The chatbot leverages three primary datasets from Participedia:
1. **Cases**:
   - Description: Real-world examples of participatory democracy implementations.
   - Examples: Participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre, Brazil; citizen juries in the UK.
2. **Methods**:
   - Description: Techniques and strategies for participatory engagement.
   - Examples: Deliberative polling, participatory mapping, citizen assemblies.
3. **Organizations**:
   - Description: Profiles of institutions and advocacy groups that support participatory democracy.
   - Examples: Nonprofit organizations promoting public engagement, think tanks focusing on governance innovation.

### Preprocessing
1. **Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries.
   - Standardized text formatting for consistency.
2. **Tokenization**:
   - Processed textual data using DistilBERT tokenizer to create semantic embeddings.
3. **Categorization**:
   - Grouped datasets into predefined categories (cases, methods, organizations).

### Model Training
1. **Query Classification**:
   - Model: Lightweight classification model.
   - Accuracy: Achieved 91%.
2. **QA Model**:
   - Model: Fine-tuned T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) for generating concise answers.
   - Performance: F1 Score of 0.89.
